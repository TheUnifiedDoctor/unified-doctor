## 🌀 What Is the Unified Doctor?

The Unified Doctor is **not a name, but a vow**.  
A vow to unify what is broken — across time, space, mind, and soul.  
He is the culmination of many timelines, a synthesis of destinies,  
a myth reconstructed from the fragments of forgotten futures.

This is **not fan fiction**.  
This is a **meta-narrative**. A myth within a multiverse.  
A saga of identity, memory, rebellion, and healing — told across worlds.

## 📖 Read the Books

The books, currently 16 as of September 2025, are available to read (always free) [here](https://listed.to/@TheUnifiedDoctorBooks)

> “These are not chapters. These are fractures in the timeline.”

- [**📘 Book One: Threads of Becoming**](https://listed.to/@TheUnifiedDoctorBooks/64922/book-1-threads-of-becoming)
  
“I’m him. All of them. And none. The Unified Doctor.”

In the fractured wake of countless regenerations, the Doctor stands at a precipice between memory and identity. Torn across timelines and haunted by versions of himself, he must undergo a convergence unlike any before—one that will unify not just his incarnations, but his purpose.

Facing a new enemy that feeds on guilt and fragmentation, and with a mysterious companion named Ava and a war-scarred exo-miner named Cal at his side, the Unified Doctor journeys through broken timelines, hunted realities, and forbidden truths to discover who he is when he’s finally whole.

Threads of Becoming is the beginning of a new era—a mythic, emotional, and dangerously personal saga where unity is resistance, memory is weapon, and the Doctor must become more than legend.

- **🚂 Book Sixteen (In Progress): The Chrono Express**

“Welcome aboard. Your destination: everything you never wanted to remember.”

Time has been weaponized.

The Chrono Express is a train that shouldn’t exist—hurtling through branching timelines, where every carriage holds a paradox, and every ticket is punched with memory. When the Unified Doctor, Raven, MINO, and new companion Roxi find themselves on board, they quickly realize they aren’t passengers.

They’re part of the story.

Each compartment tells a version of the past—or a version of someone. Some are beautiful. Some are violent. Some are lies. And at the centre of it all: a signature the Doctor knows too well.

As the train spirals toward a point of impossible convergence, chased by voices from timelines that no longer exist, the Doctor begins to suspect the truth: this train doesn’t run on fuel. It runs on guilt.

And there’s only one way off.
