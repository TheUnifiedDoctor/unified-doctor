## 🌀 What Is the Unified Doctor?

The Unified Doctor is **not a name, but a vow**.  
A vow to unify what is broken — across time, space, mind, and soul.  
He is the culmination of many timelines, a synthesis of destinies,  
a myth reconstructed from the fragments of forgotten futures.

This is **not fan fiction**.  
This is a **meta-narrative**. A myth within a multiverse.  
A saga of identity, memory, rebellion, and healing — told across worlds.

If you're not at all familiar with **Doctor Who**, here's a series of background introductory writings:

“Welcome aboard. Your destination: everything you never wanted to remember.”

Time has been weaponized.

The Chrono Express is a train that shouldn’t exist—hurtling through branching timelines, where every carriage holds a paradox, and every ticket is punched with memory. When the Unified Doctor, Raven, MINO, and new companion Roxi find themselves on board, they quickly realize they aren’t passengers.

They’re part of the story.

Each compartment tells a version of the past—or a version of someone. Some are beautiful. Some are violent. Some are lies. And at the centre of it all: a signature the Doctor knows too well.

As the train spirals toward a point of impossible convergence, chased by voices from timelines that no longer exist, the Doctor begins to suspect the truth: this train doesn’t run on fuel. It runs on guilt.

And there’s only one way off.

## 🔉 Audiobooks

The books are currently being developed into audiobooks & audioplays; if you're a voice actor interested in getting involved we'd love to have you - no experience (just enthusiam) required.

Benefits such as having an acting credit listed on IMDb, adding a widely distributed story to your portfolio and a modest payment of $1 (required to be a "professional") are just a few of the things you'll get in return. Email us at `audiobooks@unified.doctor` for more information. As this is a non-profit labour-of-love unfortunately we can't engage professionals with the subsequent professional fees that are involved.
