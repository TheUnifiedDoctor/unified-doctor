## 🌀 What Is the Unified Doctor?

The Unified Doctor is **not a name, but a vow**.  
A vow to unify what is broken — across time, space, mind, and soul.  
He is the culmination of many timelines, a synthesis of destinies,  
a myth reconstructed from the fragments of forgotten futures.

This is **not fan fiction**.  
This is a **meta-narrative**. A myth within a multiverse.  
A saga of identity, memory, rebellion, and healing — told across worlds.
