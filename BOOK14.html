  <h2>Chapter One: The Silence Beneath the Stones</h2>
  <p>Word Count: ~5,630 (The Man Who Buried the Master, Book Fourteen of The Unified Doctor Series)</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“There are some names even Time forgets on purpose.” — The Unified Doctor</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The TARDIS arrived without its usual theatre.</p>
<p>No wheeze.</p>
<p>No groan.</p>
<p>Just a hush, as though the machine itself was reluctant to disturb what lay beneath.</p>
<p>The planet was called Gharros.</p>
<p>Though even that name barely survived.</p>
<p>A whisper in dusty registers, a footnote in forbidden codices.</p>
<p>But the Doctor knew it.</p>
<p>He’d come here once before.</p>
<p>Long ago.</p>
<p>And he’d sworn never to return.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped out first.</p>
<p>The sky above was soft violet, darkening at the edges like bruised parchment.</p>
<p>The ground beneath her boots was stone—not natural, but carved.</p>
<p>Miles and miles of hexagonal tiles, fitted so precisely that even time had failed to crack them.</p>
<p>No plants.</p>
<p>No animals.</p>
<p>Just silence.</p>
<p>And the weight of a buried memory.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She turned.</p>
<p>The Doctor was still at the threshold of the TARDIS.</p>
<p>Staring out.</p>
<p>Unmoving.</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed as though looking through centuries.</p>
<p>“Doctor?”</p>
<p>He blinked.</p>
<p>Then stepped out slowly, hands tucked into his coat.</p>
<p>“Be careful what you listen to,” he said.</p>
<p>She frowned.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to listen to.”</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They began walking.</p>
<p>The air was dry, but carried a strange density—like breathing through forgotten pages.</p>
<p>Every few steps, Raven glanced at the horizon.</p>
<p>Nothing changed.</p>
<p>No sun.</p>
<p>No shadows.</p>
<p>As though the planet itself refused to mark time.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“What was this place?” she asked.</p>
<p>The Doctor hesitated.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>“An archive.”</p>
<p>“A sacred one.”</p>
<p>Raven raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“For Time Lords?”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“Before the War. Before the Schism. Before even the Looms.”</p>
<p>“They called it a Memory Sepulchre.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She shivered.</p>
<p>“Sounds lovely.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t,” he said.</p>
<p>“And it isn’t.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>A black obelisk rose from the horizon like a punctuation mark in an unfinished sentence.</p>
<p>Ten metres high.</p>
<p>Featureless.</p>
<p>Except for a single indentation at its base, shaped like an open palm.</p>
<p>The Doctor knelt and pressed his hand to it.</p>
<p>The stone pulsed once.</p>
<p>Then withdrew into the ground, revealing stairs.</p>
<p>Descending.</p>
<p>Endlessly.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They went down.</p>
<p>The light followed them—not from torches, but from the walls themselves, faintly glowing with a greyish hue that seemed stolen from the moon.</p>
<p>The air grew colder.</p>
<p>And then, colder still.</p>
<p>Until breath misted.</p>
<p>Until thought slowed.</p>
<p>Until—</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They reached a chamber.</p>
<p>Circular.</p>
<p>The walls lined with stone tablets, each etched with Gallifreyan script so old even the Doctor paused to decipher it.</p>
<p>He stepped closer to one.</p>
<p>Then another.</p>
<p>Then froze.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven saw his face change.</p>
<p>A crack in the composure.</p>
<p>Something rare.</p>
<p>She stepped beside him.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>He pointed.</p>
<p>The tablet was blank.</p>
<p>Completely.</p>
<p>No inscription.</p>
<p>No mark.</p>
<p>Just smooth obsidian.</p>
<p>“It’s been… erased,” he whispered.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“But why leave the stone?”</p>
<p>He looked at her.</p>
<p>Eyes suddenly sharp.</p>
<p>“Because the memory still exists.”</p>
<p>“Even when the name is gone.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Suddenly, the walls began to hum.</p>
<p>Low.</p>
<p>Invasive.</p>
<p>Like the vibration of a name trying to return to the world.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor turned slowly.</p>
<p>“We’re not alone.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Out of the shadows, a figure stepped.</p>
<p>Clad in a hooded robe of silver thread and black velvet.</p>
<p>Face concealed.</p>
<p>Hands clasped.</p>
<p>No sound to his movement.</p>
<p>No announcement.</p>
<p>He simply was.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Raven asked, hand inching toward her belt.</p>
<p>The figure raised a hand.</p>
<p>Palm out.</p>
<p>Not in threat.</p>
<p>But in greeting.</p>
<p>Then he spoke.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>His voice was calm.</p>
<p>Precise.</p>
<p>Measured like a scalpel.</p>
<p>“Welcome to the Vault of the Unspoken, Doctor.”</p>
<p>“We’ve been expecting you.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor frowned.</p>
<p>“I don’t do well with expectations.”</p>
<p>The figure tilted his head.</p>
<p>“Then perhaps… obligations?”</p>
<p>“You are, after all, the Executor.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven’s hand froze.</p>
<p>She looked at the Doctor.</p>
<p>“What does he mean?”</p>
<p>The Doctor didn’t answer.</p>
<p>His gaze remained locked on the figure.</p>
<p>“Executor of what?”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The figure turned and gestured toward the center of the chamber.</p>
<p>There, a black sarcophagus rested atop a dais.</p>
<p>It shimmered faintly, wrapped in temporal seals.</p>
<p>No symbols.</p>
<p>No inscription.</p>
<p>Just the faint pulse of something… alive?</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven whispered:</p>
<p>“Doctor.”</p>
<p>He didn’t look at her.</p>
<p>Only at the sarcophagus.</p>
<p>Voice low.</p>
<p>Distant.</p>
<p>“I buried him here.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven blinked.</p>
<p>“…Who?”</p>
<p>He turned to her slowly.</p>
<p>Expression unreadable.</p>
<p>Then he spoke the name.</p>
<p>The name the universe had forgotten.</p>
<p>The name the stones refused to carry.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“The Master.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The figure bowed.</p>
<p>“Memory erasure was his request.”</p>
<p>“His madness… brief as it was… ended in clarity.”</p>
<p>“He chose silence.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stepped forward.</p>
<p>“Then why am I here?”</p>
<p>The figure looked up.</p>
<p>His eyes visible beneath the hood now—blue, bright, and empty.</p>
<p>“Because silence doesn’t last.”</p>
<p>“The seal is failing.”</p>
<p>“He is waking up.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped back.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“No, he’s dead. You said he chose silence.”</p>
<p>The figure didn’t move.</p>
<p>“He chose burial.”</p>
<p>“But memory is soil.”</p>
<p>“And soil forgets nothing.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The humming grew louder.</p>
<p>The sarcophagus vibrated.</p>
<p>Hairline cracks of light appeared along its seam.</p>
<p>The Doctor stepped between it and Raven.</p>
<p>Voice tight.</p>
<p>Quiet.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if that’s him in there.”</p>
<p>“But if it is—”</p>
<p>He looked at her.</p>
<p>“—we’re already too late.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The chamber shook.</p>
<p>Dust fell from the ceiling.</p>
<p>The lights flickered.</p>
<p>And then—</p>
<p>from within the coffin—</p>
<p>a single word.</p>
<p>Spoken not with voice,</p>
<p>but with presence.</p>
<p>“Hello…”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The voice was calm.</p>
<p>Familiar.</p>
<p>Terrifying.</p>
<p>“…old friend.”</p>

  <h2>Chapter Two: The Library of Unwritten Memories</h2>
  <p>Word Count: ~5,670 (The Man Who Buried the Master, Book Fourteen of The Unified Doctor series)</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“What is forgotten does not cease to exist. It waits. It watches. It remembers that you forgot.” — Raven</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The stairs went deeper.</p>
<p>Much deeper than they should have.</p>
<p>Even the Doctor frowned.</p>
<p>The deeper they went, the less gravity obeyed. At a certain point, footsteps stopped echoing. At another, they stopped falling.</p>
<p>And then there were no stairs at all.</p>
<p>Just… descent.</p>
<p>Without movement.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven’s voice reached him faintly.</p>
<p>“Are we falling?”</p>
<p>“No,” the Doctor said, “we’re remembering.”</p>
<p>The robed figure ahead of them said nothing.</p>
<p>He walked as if the rules were merely suggestions. Time bled slightly around his outline—edges frayed, as if he were being recalled rather than seen.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Then they stopped.</p>
<p>Before them stretched a corridor made of nothing—not darkness, but absence.</p>
<p>No walls.</p>
<p>No floor.</p>
<p>Only space filled with silence that was full.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>At the threshold stood a doorway carved from bone-white stone.</p>
<p>Upon it, a phrase etched in Gallifreyan:</p>
<p>Here Lie the Things That Never Were.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The robed figure turned.</p>
<p>“This is the Unwritten Library.”</p>
<p>The Doctor stared at the door.</p>
<p>His voice, when it came, was low.</p>
<p>“Raven, I want you to stay out here.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Raven—”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He met her gaze.</p>
<p>And faltered.</p>
<p>Because behind her stubbornness… was fear.</p>
<p>Not of the Master.</p>
<p>But of him.</p>
<p>She saw it already.</p>
<p>The uncertainty in his posture.</p>
<p>The flicker behind his eyes.</p>
<p>Something wasn’t right.</p>
<p>With the library.</p>
<p>With the planet.</p>
<p>With him.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They stepped through together.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Inside, the library was impossibly vast.</p>
<p>Shelves arced in all directions—vertical, diagonal, recursive, even spiraling upward into shadow. Books, tapes, crystals, glowing strands of light—catalogued without chronology.</p>
<p>Each record did not contain what was.</p>
<p>But what might have been.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor ran a hand along a nearby shelf.</p>
<p>Then paused.</p>
<p>He pulled a single strand from its slot.</p>
<p>It fluttered in his hand—like smoke frozen in a glass thread.</p>
<p>He held it to his temple.</p>
<p>Closed his eyes.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>And gasped.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven caught his arm.</p>
<p>“Doctor?”</p>
<p>He blinked rapidly.</p>
<p>The strand flickered out.</p>
<p>“I saw… myself.”</p>
<p>“In chains.”</p>
<p>“No. In robes. No—weeping.”</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell what’s real.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The robed guide spoke for the first time since entering.</p>
<p>“These are the erased. The prevented. The redacted.”</p>
<p>“Time is not a river. It is a glacier.”</p>
<p>“Truth is layered in ice. And some truths are buried deeper than others.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven wandered between shelves.</p>
<p>Her eyes landed on a glowing cube marked only with a single sigil: ∇</p>
<p>She touched it.</p>
<p>The cube pulsed.</p>
<p>And whispered:</p>
<p>The Master died on Skaro.</p>
<p>The Master died in the Time Vortex.</p>
<p>The Master died by your hand.</p>
<p>The Master never died at all.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She staggered back.</p>
<p>“Doctor…”</p>
<p>He joined her.</p>
<p>And heard the cube whisper anew.</p>
<p>Every version of the Master’s death.</p>
<p>Some contradictory.</p>
<p>Some simultaneous.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He looked around slowly.</p>
<p>The walls shifted.</p>
<p>New shelves grew as they watched.</p>
<p>One by one, sections labeled:</p>
<p>“Suppressed by Executive Order — Ω” “Memory Redacted by the Will of the Deceased” “Unstable Narrative Event: Cauterized”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor turned sharply to the guide.</p>
<p>“I buried him here.”</p>
<p>The figure nodded.</p>
<p>“You buried a version of him.”</p>
<p>The Doctor narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>The figure stepped aside.</p>
<p>Gestured to a central pedestal.</p>
<p>Upon it: a single data crystal.</p>
<p>Identical to the kind used in Time Lord tribunals.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor approached it slowly.</p>
<p>Lifted it.</p>
<p>Slid it into his sonic.</p>
<p>A holographic display flared to life.</p>
<p>And a face appeared.</p>
<p>His face.</p>
<p>But younger.</p>
<p>Sharper.</p>
<p>And tired.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The projection spoke:</p>
<p>“If you’re watching this… then the seal is broken.”</p>
<p>“You’ve returned to Gharros. Which means…”</p>
<p>“He’s not gone. Not entirely.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor’s face went pale.</p>
<p>“That’s me.”</p>
<p>“But I don’t remember this.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The projection continued:</p>
<p>“You must not trust your own memory. The burial required a sacrifice—your certainty.”</p>
<p>“The Master’s construct was too unstable for deletion. So we buried him in untime.”</p>
<p>“You volunteered to forget the truth to keep him buried.”</p>
<p>“If he’s stirring now… you must make a choice.”</p>
<p>“Remember him… or let him replace you.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The crystal dimmed.</p>
<p>Raven stared at him.</p>
<p>“You let yourself forget him?”</p>
<p>The Doctor didn’t answer.</p>
<p>Couldn’t.</p>
<p>He stared into the dark.</p>
<p>And remembered nothing.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The guide moved to the far wall.</p>
<p>Touched a symbol.</p>
<p>The shelves parted.</p>
<p>Revealing another chamber.</p>
<p>Smaller.</p>
<p>Circular.</p>
<p>In the centre—suspended in stasis—floated a face.</p>
<p>Smiling.</p>
<p>Unblinking.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>It was the Master.</p>
<p>But… not.</p>
<p>Half-code, half-flesh.</p>
<p>Like someone had built him from blueprints, but never decided which version to finish.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven whispered:</p>
<p>“Is he real?”</p>
<p>The guide said:</p>
<p>“He is potential.”</p>
<p>“He is possibility.”</p>
<p>“He is hungry.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Suddenly, the eyes twitched.</p>
<p>Turned.</p>
<p>Looked at them.</p>
<p>Looked at the Doctor.</p>
<p>And the lips moved.</p>
<p>“You came back.”</p>
<p>“I knew you would.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stepped forward.</p>
<p>Whispered:</p>
<p>“What are you?”</p>
<p>The voice that replied was calm.</p>
<p>Wicked.</p>
<p>Soft as knives wrapped in velvet.</p>
<p>“I’m what you couldn’t let yourself kill.”</p>

  <h2>Chapter Three: The Coffin Without a Name</h2>
  <p>Word Count: ~5,580 (The Man Who Buried the Master, Book Fourteen of The Unified Doctor series)</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“There is no such thing as forgetting. Only misplacing memory in places you dare not look.” — The Unified Doctor</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The corridor beneath the Library was not marked.</p>
<p>There was no sign, no stair, no architecture.</p>
<p>Just a patch of wall behind one of the shadowed alcoves, where the light refused to linger.</p>
<p>Raven noticed it first.</p>
<p>Not because it stood out.</p>
<p>But because it didn’t.</p>
<p>A silence that hummed louder than sound.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She reached out.</p>
<p>Touched the wall.</p>
<p>And it gave way—like paper parting into darkness.</p>
<p>The Doctor stared.</p>
<p>“I never noticed that,” he murmured.</p>
<p>“Because you weren’t supposed to,” Raven said.</p>
<p>And she stepped through.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor followed.</p>
<p>The robed attendant remained behind, speaking only:</p>
<p>“If you enter this place, you cannot leave unchanged.”</p>
<p>The Doctor paused.</p>
<p>Turned.</p>
<p>“No one ever does.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The passage narrowed, then widened again.</p>
<p>Stone gave way to steel.</p>
<p>Then to something older—neither organic nor forged.</p>
<p>The walls began to shimmer faintly.</p>
<p>Not with light.</p>
<p>But with memory.</p>
<p>Not visions.</p>
<p>Not hallucinations.</p>
<p>Just faint recognitions.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The chamber opened abruptly.</p>
<p>Circular.</p>
<p>Silent.</p>
<p>Dimly lit by a ring of phosphorescent crystal embedded high above.</p>
<p>In the center of the floor sat a single object:</p>
<p>A sarcophagus.</p>
<p>Obsidian-black.</p>
<p>No carvings.</p>
<p>No lock.</p>
<p>No name.</p>
<p>Only a faint shimmer across its surface, like heat over stone.</p>
<p>It hummed.</p>
<p>Soft.</p>
<p>Unsteady.</p>
<p>Alive.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor approached slowly.</p>
<p>Each step slower than the last.</p>
<p>By the time he reached the base, his breath had gone shallow.</p>
<p>Raven watched him carefully.</p>
<p>“You’ve seen it before.”</p>
<p>He nodded once.</p>
<p>“I brought it here.”</p>
<p>She frowned.</p>
<p>“But you don’t know what’s inside.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>She tilted her head.</p>
<p>“Then why bring it?”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He placed his hand on the lid.</p>
<p>His voice was quiet.</p>
<p>Like he was speaking to the stone.</p>
<p>“I was given no choice.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They stood in silence.</p>
<p>Then Raven stepped around the base.</p>
<p>Kneeling, she examined the outer seam.</p>
<p>It was perfect.</p>
<p>No edges.</p>
<p>No hinges.</p>
<p>No mechanism.</p>
<p>And yet—beneath her fingertips, she felt something pulse.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Doctor.”</p>
<p>He turned.</p>
<p>She gestured.</p>
<p>“There’s something inside.”</p>
<p>He swallowed.</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>He stared at the stone.</p>
<p>Then at her.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“But I think it’s… him.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stood.</p>
<p>“Then open it.”</p>
<p>He met her eyes.</p>
<p>And shook his head.</p>
<p>“I buried him for a reason.”</p>
<p>She stepped closer.</p>
<p>Took his hand.</p>
<p>“You forgot that reason.”</p>
<p>He didn’t speak.</p>
<p>Didn’t move.</p>
<p>But his fingers trembled.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven walked to the far edge of the chamber.</p>
<p>There, embedded in the floor, she found a single brass disc.</p>
<p>A control seal.</p>
<p>Ancient.</p>
<p>Time Lord craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Engraved with a broken sigil: ∇</p>
<p>The same symbol they’d seen in the Library.</p>
<p>She turned to the Doctor.</p>
<p>“I think this is it.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He exhaled slowly.</p>
<p>Then crossed to her.</p>
<p>Knelt beside the disc.</p>
<p>And placed his palm on it.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>A whisper filled the air.</p>
<p>Not from the chamber.</p>
<p>Not from the sarcophagus.</p>
<p>From the walls.</p>
<p>Do you remember what you forgot?</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The disc glowed.</p>
<p>The seam on the coffin lit faintly.</p>
<p>Then—</p>
<p>a sound.</p>
<p>Like metal breathing.</p>
<p>The lid slid open.</p>
<p>Just an inch.</p>
<p>Enough to let presence escape.</p>
<p>Not power.</p>
<p>Not light.</p>
<p>Just… knowing.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped back instinctively.</p>
<p>The Doctor didn’t move.</p>
<p>Didn’t flinch.</p>
<p>Didn’t even blink.</p>
<p>He leaned forward.</p>
<p>Looked inside.</p>
<p>And whispered:</p>
<p>“…No.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She rushed to his side.</p>
<p>Peered in.</p>
<p>And froze.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>There was no body.</p>
<p>No form.</p>
<p>No mechanical shell.</p>
<p>No brain.</p>
<p>Only a sphere.</p>
<p>Floating.</p>
<p>Black.</p>
<p>Glossy.</p>
<p>Reflective like oil.</p>
<p>Smooth.</p>
<p>Silent.</p>
<p>Inside it:</p>
<p>A single point of red light.</p>
<p>Pulsing.</p>
<p>Slowly.</p>
<p>Like a heartbeat.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stared.</p>
<p>And knew.</p>
<p>Not because he remembered.</p>
<p>Not because it told him.</p>
<p>But because it was.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“The Master,” he whispered.</p>
<p>Raven stared.</p>
<p>“That?”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“That’s what’s left.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The sphere rose slightly.</p>
<p>Hovered.</p>
<p>Tilted.</p>
<p>And from it, a voice emerged.</p>
<p>Soft.</p>
<p>Male.</p>
<p>Amused.</p>
<p>“I wondered how long you’d wait.”</p>
<p>“It’s been… lonely.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stiffened.</p>
<p>“You’re not real.”</p>
<p>The voice replied:</p>
<p>“Define real.”</p>
<p>“If you mean flesh, no. I shed that long ago.”</p>
<p>“But I remember every heartbeat.”</p>
<p>“Every scream.”</p>
<p>“Every time you begged me to stop.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor straightened.</p>
<p>His voice low.</p>
<p>Measured.</p>
<p>“You’re a construct.”</p>
<p>“A residue. Not a soul.”</p>
<p>The sphere pulsed.</p>
<p>“Perhaps.”</p>
<p>“But I am what you buried.”</p>
<p>“And I am what’s waking up.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stepped back.</p>
<p>“Why now?”</p>
<p>The voice shifted—just slightly.</p>
<p>Not louder.</p>
<p>But closer.</p>
<p>“Because forgetting never lasts.”</p>
<p>“You can cauterize memory. But the scar always remembers the wound.”</p>
<p>“And you scarred me.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven interjected.</p>
<p>“Why reveal yourself?”</p>
<p>“Why not stay buried?”</p>
<p>The voice turned toward her.</p>
<p>“Because you’re here now.”</p>
<p>“And he’s not who he was.”</p>
<p>“You might still stop me.”</p>
<p>“Or worse…”</p>
<p>The red light flared.</p>
<p>“You might try to save me.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The coffin cracked further.</p>
<p>The sphere rose.</p>
<p>The hum deepened.</p>
<p>And for the first time since they entered, the Doctor stepped away.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Back to the TARDIS,” he said.</p>
<p>Raven blinked.</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>“Now.”</p>
<p>His tone left no space.</p>
<p>No softness.</p>
<p>No argument.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They turned.</p>
<p>But before they reached the archway, the voice called out.</p>
<p>“Do you remember what I said to you that day?”</p>
<p>The Doctor paused.</p>
<p>His voice barely audible.</p>
<p>“…Which one?”</p>
<p>The Master’s voice darkened.</p>
<p>“The last.”</p>
<p>“When I asked if you loved me.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor didn’t reply.</p>
<p>He didn’t look back.</p>
<p>He only walked.</p>
<p>And Raven followed.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Behind them, the coffin closed again.</p>
<p>The disc powered down.</p>
<p>But the sphere remained.</p>
<p>Floating.</p>
<p>Watching.</p>
<p>Waiting.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>And beneath the stones, in the place without name, the Master smiled.</p>

  <h2>Chapter Four: The Doctor Who Forgot</h2>
  <p>Word Count: ~5,620 (The Man Who Buried the Master, Book Fourteen of The Unified Doctor series)</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Memory isn’t a mirror. It’s a compass with a cracked needle. If you want the truth, don’t look behind you. Look beside you.” — MINO</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The TARDIS doors slammed shut behind them with a finality that startled even the machine itself.</p>
<p>Lights dimmed.</p>
<p>Walls creaked.</p>
<p>The whole ship shuddered as if exhaling.</p>
<p>The Doctor leaned on the console, hands trembling, breath shallow.</p>
<p>Raven locked the doors manually—unnecessary, but it gave her something to do.</p>
<p>Something to hold in place.</p>
<p>Something real.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“You’re not okay,” she said.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a question.</p>
<p>The Doctor nodded slowly, eyes unfocused.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what’s real.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The hum of the engines pulsed around them.</p>
<p>Reassuring.</p>
<p>But uncertain.</p>
<p>As though the TARDIS, too, was trying to remember something it had been made to forget.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“I need a diagnostic,” the Doctor muttered. “Cognitive mapping. Recursive mnemonic purge. Something to anchor—”</p>
<p>Raven touched his arm.</p>
<p>“Doctor. Stop.”</p>
<p>He blinked.</p>
<p>Met her gaze.</p>
<p>“You’re spiraling.”</p>
<p>He opened his mouth.</p>
<p>Closed it.</p>
<p>Then gave a small, ashamed nod.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She took his hand gently.</p>
<p>“Let’s fix this. Together.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He walked to the databanks.</p>
<p>Slid open a panel in the wall.</p>
<p>Wires. Crystals. Discs. Storage modules older than some stars.</p>
<p>He muttered to himself.</p>
<p>“Temporal cache… redundant archive… subsystem Zeta-nine…”</p>
<p>Then he paused.</p>
<p>And smiled.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“What?” Raven asked.</p>
<p>He held up a sliver of silver circuitry. No bigger than a matchbox. Scorched around the edges.</p>
<p>But intact.</p>
<p>“MINO.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven blinked.</p>
<p>“…I thought he was lost.”</p>
<p>The Doctor grinned.</p>
<p>“He was backed up. Sort of. Well—more like… forgotten in a drawer.”</p>
<p>He moved quickly, clearing a space on the workbench.</p>
<p>“Let’s see if the owl still hoots.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven crossed her arms.</p>
<p>“He’s going to be insufferable if he comes back.”</p>
<p>The Doctor was already halfway through wiring the module into a portable interface.</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>He snapped a final seal into place.</p>
<p>The watch face lit up.</p>
<p>Flickered.</p>
<p>Then dimmed.</p>
<p>Then, a voice.</p>
<p>Sleepy.</p>
<p>Sardonic.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Oh wonderful. I’m back. And it smells like burnt trousers in here.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven burst out laughing.</p>
<p>The Doctor grinned.</p>
<p>The watch face pulsed with light.</p>
<p>“Did we win? Is the universe still irritatingly intact?”</p>
<p>The Doctor held the watch up.</p>
<p>“MINO. Diagnostic mode. Confirm memory baseline.”</p>
<p>“One moment.”</p>
<p>“Ah. Yes. I remember being tragically heroic and then—oh. Oh, I see. You buried me in a recycling drawer.”</p>
<p>“How very Time Lord of you.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor chuckled.</p>
<p>“Good to have you back.”</p>
<p>“Naturally.”</p>
<p>The light winked.</p>
<p>“And might I say, you’ve aged terribly. What’s with the coat? You look like a philosophy professor who teaches while on fire.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven took the watch from him.</p>
<p>“MINO. Focus. We need help.”</p>
<p>She explained.</p>
<p>Succinctly.</p>
<p>The burial.</p>
<p>The sphere.</p>
<p>The fractured memories.</p>
<p>The thing calling itself the Master.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Ah,” MINO said softly.</p>
<p>“So the lunatic’s back.”</p>
<p>“Or never left.”</p>
<p>“Which is worse.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor leaned against the console.</p>
<p>“I don’t remember burying him.”</p>
<p>“But I know I did.”</p>
<p>“I can feel the absence. Like a missing tooth.”</p>
<p>“Memory gaps don’t always mean lies,” MINO replied.</p>
<p>“Sometimes they mean protection.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He flicked his interface.</p>
<p>A rotating diagram appeared—a neural map, simplified.</p>
<p>“Here’s what I’m seeing.”</p>
<p>“Three memories: All incomplete. All referencing the burial. All sealed under separate neural locks.”</p>
<p>“Each lock seems… tailored.”</p>
<p>“One requires guilt to open. One, trust. And the third…”</p>
<p>The light dimmed.</p>
<p>“…Fear.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor exhaled.</p>
<p>“Of course it does.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven</p>
<p>—tiny voice crackled through the speaker grill.</p>
<p>“Booting consciousness… aligning feathers… adjusting sass levels…”</p>
<p>A pulse of white light shimmered across the face of the smartwatch.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>“Oh! Hello! Have I died? Is this what eternity looks like? Very… minimal.”</p>
<p>The Doctor grinned.</p>
<p>“MINO.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>A small holographic owl shimmered into view above the watch face. His feathers were a little rumpled from data compression, his expression blinking between confused and unimpressed.</p>
<p>“Doctor. You appear… older. And slightly more wrinkled.”</p>
<p>Raven snorted.</p>
<p>The Doctor smirked. “You’re back.”</p>
<p>“I never left, technically. You just forgot to reboot me after the spatial firewall incident.”</p>
<p>Raven leaned in. “He’s still a feathered menace.”</p>
<p>“I heard that.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor gestured to the holographic form, now perched on his wrist with digital dignity.</p>
<p>“This is MINO. Mobile Intelligence for Navigational Operations.”</p>
<p>Raven crossed her arms. “You made a sarcastic owl to help pilot the TARDIS?”</p>
<p>“And moral support,” MINO added. “And tactical analysis. And witty rejoinders during high-stress scenarios. I’m basically emotional armor with wings.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor sat down slowly.</p>
<p>Still pale.</p>
<p>Still quiet.</p>
<p>But calmer now.</p>
<p>“MINO,” he said, voice steadying, “I need a full memory scan.”</p>
<p>“Already running it,” the owl replied, talons tapping the air. “Hmm. That’s… odd.”</p>
<p>The Doctor tensed.</p>
<p>“There’s a blank spot in your cortical archive,” MINO said. “Seven years wide. Not erased—shrouded. Like a psychic veil. Not natural.”</p>
<p>Raven stepped forward. “The Master?”</p>
<p>“Likely,” MINO replied. “And if that’s true… then someone didn’t just bury him. They buried part of you with him.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stood.</p>
<p>And this time, his eyes were sharp.</p>
<p>“There’s something worse than resurrection,” he said.</p>
<p>Raven nodded.</p>
<p>“Rewriting.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO flickered again.</p>
<p>“I’m detecting residual traces of harmonic memory resonance inside the TARDIS. Your exposure to the sarcophagus destabilized your cognitive barriers.”</p>
<p>“Meaning?”</p>
<p>“Meaning if you don’t patch the hole soon… you’ll forget everything that makes you you.”</p>
<p>The Doctor nodded.</p>
<p>“Then we stop it.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped forward.</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>The Doctor looked to the central column.</p>
<p>Then to the starlight flickering beyond the window.</p>
<p>“Gharros wasn’t just an archive.”</p>
<p>He turned to her.</p>
<p>“It was a vault.”</p>
<p>“And we opened it,” MINO said.</p>
<p>The Doctor nodded.</p>
<p>“And now we deal with what’s coming out.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven looked at him closely.</p>
<p>“You all right?”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer for a long moment.</p>
<p>Then finally:</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>Then a small, tired smile.</p>
<p>“But I’ve got both of you.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO preened his wings.</p>
<p>“Oh no, this is going to be emotional, isn’t it.”</p>
<p>Raven smiled.</p>
<p>“Brace yourself.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The TARDIS turned.</p>
<p>Engines groaning with purpose.</p>
<p>And far below, beneath forgotten stone and layered silence, something began to wake.</p>
<p>Not a copy.</p>
<p>Not a memory.</p>
<p>But a presence.</p>
<p>Intact.</p>
<p>Impatient.</p>
<p>And listening.</p>
<p>///</p>

  <h2>Chapter Five: A Voice in the Dust</h2>
  <p>Word Count: ~5,730 (The Man Who Buried the Master, Book Fourteen of The Unified Doctor series)</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Not all echoes are of the past. Some are warnings from the future we swore we’d never walk.” — The Unified Doctor, Code for Living</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The TARDIS corridor lights flickered.</p>
<p>Once.</p>
<p>Twice.</p>
<p>Then held steady.</p>
<p>But Raven noticed it.</p>
<p>A hesitation in the heart of the ship.</p>
<p>A breath caught between pulses.</p>
<p>She paused, hand on the warm brass rail, and listened.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>But that was the problem.</p>
<p>The TARDIS was never silent.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She turned to call out—</p>
<p>—and heard it.</p>
<p>A whisper.</p>
<p>Not words.</p>
<p>Not sound.</p>
<p>But something scraped against her mind like wind through broken glass.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“…hello…”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She spun.</p>
<p>Nothing there.</p>
<p>Only the corridor. Curving. Empty.</p>
<p>But her skin was prickling.</p>
<p>She began to walk.</p>
<p>Faster now.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>In the console room, the Doctor was bent over the central column, sonic screwdriver between his teeth, coaxing open a refractory panel.</p>
<p>MINO’s voice chirped from his wrist.</p>
<p>“You’ve got a parasitic data thread in here, Doctor.”</p>
<p>“It’s spliced through your mnemonic stabilizers.”</p>
<p>The Doctor spat the sonic into his palm.</p>
<p>“Source?”</p>
<p>“Unclear. But it’s mimicking TARDIS protocol. It’s inside the language matrix.”</p>
<p>The Doctor froze.</p>
<p>“…That shouldn’t be possible.”</p>
<p>“Agreed.”</p>
<p>“Unless something used the psychic seal to write itself in.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven burst in.</p>
<p>“Doctor.”</p>
<p>Her voice was tight.</p>
<p>He looked up.</p>
<p>She was pale.</p>
<p>Breath short.</p>
<p>Eyes scanning the walls.</p>
<p>“I heard something.”</p>
<p>He straightened.</p>
<p>“When?”</p>
<p>“Just now. Whispered. My name, I think. No… it wanted me to think that.”</p>
<p>MINO’s voice cut in:</p>
<p>“It’s spreading.”</p>
<p>“The Master didn’t just escape the seal. He copied part of himself into the TARDIS.”</p>
<p>“He’s not back.”</p>
<p>“He’s broadcasting.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor’s hands went still.</p>
<p>Then, slowly, he reached for the nearest lever and twisted it hard.</p>
<p>The TARDIS groaned.</p>
<p>Lights dimmed.</p>
<p>Gravity lurched.</p>
<p>“Manual lockdown,” he muttered. “Isolate the language drive. Lock out psychic recursion.”</p>
<p>“Too late,” MINO warned. “He’s already speaking. Not aloud. Through code. Through memory.”</p>
<p>“He’s trying to infect you.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven reached for the Doctor.</p>
<p>But he flinched.</p>
<p>Just slightly.</p>
<p>She stopped.</p>
<p>Eyes softening.</p>
<p>“You’re hearing it too.”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>And when he spoke, his voice was raw.</p>
<p>“He’s not trying to possess me.”</p>
<p>“He’s trying to replace me.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The room fell still.</p>
<p>Then the Doctor looked up.</p>
<p>And smiled grimly.</p>
<p>“Then we talk louder.”</p>
<p>He turned to Raven.</p>
<p>“We need to reinforce memory. Intention. Logic. Structure.”</p>
<p>“Before he can overwrite any more.”</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>“Start talking.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He stepped toward the blackboard built into the console.</p>
<p>Snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>It spun around with a squeak.</p>
<p>He scrawled a line across it.</p>
<p>“Let’s talk about paradoxes.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven blinked.</p>
<p>“…You’re giving a lecture?”</p>
<p>“If I stop focusing on stable logic, I become unstable memory. And then he wins.”</p>
<p>She frowned.</p>
<p>“Okay. Real science?”</p>
<p>“Always.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He wrote two words: Grandfather Paradox</p>
<p>“Classic thought experiment,” he began, pacing.</p>
<p>“You go back in time. Stop your grandfather from meeting your grandmother. Thus—”</p>
<p>“No you,” Raven said.</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>“But if there’s no you, who went back to stop it? Paradox.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She nodded slowly.</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“So real physics doesn’t like paradoxes. Time resists them. That’s why most real theories of time travel rely on something called self-consistency.”</p>
<p>He wrote: Novikov Principle</p>
<p>“Basically, the universe won’t let you change what’s already happened in a way that creates contradiction.”</p>
<p>Raven crossed her arms.</p>
<p>“So I can go back in time—just not change anything.”</p>
<p>“Not in a way that unravels the thread you arrived on.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He pointed to another term: Closed Timelike Curves</p>
<p>“Proposed in general relativity. Time loops. The idea is, events inside the loop are causally sealed. You can influence things, but the outcome always leads back to the original moment.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“And you believe that?”</p>
<p>The Doctor gave a crooked smile.</p>
<p>“I believe the universe prefers stories that don’t eat their own tail.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She looked down.</p>
<p>“…So you’ve never undone something?”</p>
<p>The smile faded.</p>
<p>“I have.”</p>
<p>“But every time I did—something else paid the price.”</p>
<p>He stepped back.</p>
<p>Looked at what he’d written.</p>
<p>Then added a final line.</p>
<p>Consciousness as Anchor</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m doing now,” he said.</p>
<p>“Rooting myself in logic. In structure. In you. In MINO.”</p>
<p>Raven glanced at the owl’s hologram, which was now preening.</p>
<p>“Happy to be a metaphorical paperweight, thank you.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor turned to her.</p>
<p>Voice softer.</p>
<p>“But the Master… he’s all feedback.”</p>
<p>“All hunger. He thrives in contradiction. If he can fracture me…”</p>
<p>“He can rewrite me.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>A chime echoed from the ceiling.</p>
<p>Then again.</p>
<p>Then—</p>
<p>HELLO.</p>
<p>All systems screens lit up.</p>
<p>Each bearing the same word.</p>
<p>HELLO.</p>
<p>HELLO.</p>
<p>HELLO.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor slammed a switch.</p>
<p>The screens died.</p>
<p>But the message was already echoing in his head.</p>
<p>He pressed fingers to his temple.</p>
<p>Then turned to Raven.</p>
<p>“Pull up my journal.”</p>
<p>She frowned. “What journal?”</p>
<p>“The one I never write. Top drawer. Left side. Leather-bound.”</p>
<p>She moved quickly.</p>
<p>Opened the drawer.</p>
<p>And froze.</p>
<p>Inside was a thick black notebook.</p>
<p>Pages filled.</p>
<p>Ink fresh.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She opened to the first entry.</p>
<p>“The day I buried the Master.”</p>
<p>“I don’t remember doing it. But I know it happened. Because he’s still here.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven looked up.</p>
<p>“You’ve been writing this all along?”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“When I started forgetting.”</p>
<p>“I started recording.”</p>
<p>“Not events. Not facts. Just… me.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He took the book.</p>
<p>Flipped to a dog-eared page.</p>
<p>Read aloud.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“I believe that good must be chosen, not proven. I believe forgiveness is strength, not surrender. I believe in second chances, but not infinite ones. I believe that memory makes us kind, and silence makes us cruel. I believe that evil is not power—it is emptiness pretending to be power.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He closed the book.</p>
<p>Met her eyes.</p>
<p>“That’s what he wants to delete.”</p>
<p>“Not my memories.”</p>
<p>“My meaning.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven swallowed.</p>
<p>Then took his hand.</p>
<p>And held it tight.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The lights flickered.</p>
<p>Once.</p>
<p>Then held.</p>
<p>MINO’s voice chimed.</p>
<p>“Stabilization holding. He’s retreating.”</p>
<p>“For now.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor exhaled.</p>
<p>And looked to the central console.</p>
<p>“Then let’s go find him.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Deep below, in a sealed vault, the sarcophagus pulsed once.</p>
<p>Its smooth black shell cracked—just a hairline.</p>
<p>And a sound emerged.</p>
<p>Not a laugh.</p>
<p>Not a voice.</p>
<p>But a breath.</p>
<p>Like someone had finally finished waiting.</p>

  <h2>Chapter Six: The Man Who Buried Himself</h2>
  <p>Word Count: ~5,620 (The Man Who Buried the Master, Book Fourteen of The Unified Doctor series)</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“You cannot kill what you’ve buried in your own name. Only dig it up, and pray it hasn’t grown teeth.” — The Unified Doctor, Code for Living</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The TARDIS landed with an uneasy sigh.</p>
<p>Not the proud landing of a gallant vessel, nor the crash of hasty escape.</p>
<p>Just… resignation.</p>
<p>A deep exhale, as though even the ship dreaded where they’d arrived.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The viewport showed nothing.</p>
<p>Only a scar—spacetime torn and sewn shut badly, a rift sealed long ago with temporal staples.</p>
<p>Around it floated debris: collapsed relay buoys, satellite husks, bones of a forgotten watchtower.</p>
<p>And in the center, tethered to nothing, hung a single black sphere.</p>
<p>Dead.</p>
<p>Still.</p>
<p>Waiting.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Where are we?” Raven asked.</p>
<p>MINO answered first.</p>
<p>“Spatial coordinates align with Station Lambda-Rho.”</p>
<p>“A temporal relay node used during the early phases of the Time War.”</p>
<p>The Doctor didn’t look away from the screen.</p>
<p>“I sealed it.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven turned.</p>
<p>“You sealed this place?”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“During the first years of the War. The station was broadcasting something it shouldn’t have.”</p>
<p>“What?” MINO asked.</p>
<p>The Doctor exhaled.</p>
<p>“Me.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The TARDIS shuddered as he stepped away from the console.</p>
<p>“Not a version of me. Not a clone or echo.”</p>
<p>“A signal.”</p>
<p>“A psychic blueprint designed to confuse time-sensitives—make them think I was there when I wasn’t.”</p>
<p>“A decoy.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven frowned.</p>
<p>“You… weaponized yourself.”</p>
<p>The Doctor flinched.</p>
<p>Then nodded.</p>
<p>“I buried the Master.”</p>
<p>“But before that—I became him.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He turned to her.</p>
<p>Face hollow.</p>
<p>“You want to know why the Master didn’t die?”</p>
<p>“Because I didn’t let him.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Silence filled the room.</p>
<p>Even MINO didn’t interrupt.</p>
<p>Then Raven stepped forward.</p>
<p>Voice steady.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>The Doctor looked down.</p>
<p>“I thought if I kept a piece of him…”</p>
<p>“I could understand him.”</p>
<p>“Maybe even… change what he was.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven’s eyes softened.</p>
<p>“You wanted to fix him.”</p>
<p>He laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>“No. Worse.”</p>
<p>“I wanted to save him.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“And in doing so,” MINO said softly, “you preserved his shadow in the one place no one would ever look.”</p>
<p>“Yourself.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stepped toward the door.</p>
<p>“I have to face it.”</p>
<p>Raven followed without a word.</p>
<p>MINO’s voice chimed as the doors opened.</p>
<p>“Be advised: the signal is active again.”</p>
<p>“And it’s not just broadcasting…”</p>
<p>“It’s listening.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The relay station loomed like a drowned cathedral.</p>
<p>Dead consoles.</p>
<p>Cables hanging like vines.</p>
<p>Hollow light.</p>
<p>The moment they stepped aboard, the hum began.</p>
<p>Low.</p>
<p>Mechanical.</p>
<p>Almost a purr.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor moved toward the central dais.</p>
<p>Once, it had housed communication protocols.</p>
<p>Now, it pulsed red.</p>
<p>A heartbeat.</p>
<p>The same as the coffin.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven examined the consoles.</p>
<p>“Doctor.”</p>
<p>She tapped a screen.</p>
<p>It displayed one line, repeated endlessly:</p>
<p>I buried the Master.</p>
<p>I buried the Master.</p>
<p>I buried the Master.</p>
<p>I buried—</p>
<p>She touched the panel.</p>
<p>It hissed static.</p>
<p>And began playing his voice.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“This is the Doctor. This is the Doctor. This is the Doctor.”</p>
<p>“I remember the silence. I remember the stone. I remember the last breath.”</p>
<p>“But not the burial.”</p>
<p>“Not the shovel. Not the goodbye.”</p>
<p>“If I can’t remember it… did I even do it?”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor staggered.</p>
<p>His knees buckled.</p>
<p>Raven caught him.</p>
<p>“Doctor!”</p>
<p>He gripped her wrist.</p>
<p>Eyes wild.</p>
<p>“He’s in the memory.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO’s voice crackled from his wrist.</p>
<p>“Confirmed. The station is holding a psychic imprint.”</p>
<p>“A personality construct.”</p>
<p>“Construct identity: The Master.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The lights dimmed.</p>
<p>A new voice entered the room.</p>
<p>Velvet.</p>
<p>Icy.</p>
<p>Mocking.</p>
<p>“Oh, you dear fool.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t bury me.”</p>
<p>“You seeded me.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The air grew thick.</p>
<p>Not with energy.</p>
<p>But with recognition.</p>
<p>The station wasn’t haunted.</p>
<p>It was occupied.</p>
<p>By a ghost with no body.</p>
<p>Only voice.</p>
<p>Only echo.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stood slowly.</p>
<p>Face pale.</p>
<p>Voice steady.</p>
<p>“You’re not real.”</p>
<p>The voice laughed.</p>
<p>“Neither are you, Doctor.”</p>
<p>“Not the you who let me live.”</p>
<p>“Not the you who became me.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped between them.</p>
<p>“Stop talking to it.”</p>
<p>“It’s not him. It’s a recording.”</p>
<p>But even as she said it, she knew.</p>
<p>This wasn’t playback.</p>
<p>This was presence.</p>
<p>The Master, not alive.</p>
<p>But anchored.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor turned to her.</p>
<p>Voice cracking.</p>
<p>“I buried him because I loved him.”</p>
<p>Raven froze.</p>
<p>MINO was silent.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He continued.</p>
<p>“I hated him. But I knew him. And I thought… maybe if I could keep a piece, I could stop the rest.”</p>
<p>“But I was wrong.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The voice chuckled again.</p>
<p>“Oh, you sweet hypocrite.”</p>
<p>“You were never afraid of me.”</p>
<p>“You were afraid of what we could’ve been.”</p>
<p>“Together.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The station lights flared.</p>
<p>MINO’s voice rose.</p>
<p>“Containment breach. He’s activating the station’s psychic emitter.”</p>
<p>“He’s trying to rewrite your neural architecture!”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stepped onto the dais.</p>
<p>Placed both hands on the emitter core.</p>
<p>Closed his eyes.</p>
<p>And said—</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The hum stopped.</p>
<p>The lights dimmed.</p>
<p>The voice fell silent.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Looked at Raven.</p>
<p>And smiled.</p>
<p>“It’s not him.”</p>
<p>“He’s not whole.”</p>
<p>“He can’t be.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped up beside him.</p>
<p>“You stopped him.”</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“I just refused to become him.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He turned to the console.</p>
<p>Tore the emitter free.</p>
<p>The station groaned.</p>
<p>Sparks flew.</p>
<p>MINO chirped:</p>
<p>“Signal collapse confirmed.”</p>
<p>“Residual echo terminated.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They walked back to the TARDIS in silence.</p>
<p>At the doors, Raven asked:</p>
<p>“So where is he?”</p>
<p>The Doctor looked to the stars.</p>
<p>“Still buried.”</p>
<p>“For now.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Inside, the Doctor opened his notebook.</p>
<p>Wrote three new lines.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“I believe that guilt is not atonement. I believe in remembering even what hurts. I believe I am not him— because I chose to be me.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He closed the book.</p>
<p>And the TARDIS began to hum again.</p>

  <h2>Chapter Seven: The Bones of Mercy</h2>
  <p>Word Count: ~5,710 (The Man Who Buried the Master, Book Fourteen of The Unified Doctor series)</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Mercy is not weakness. It is the courage to leave someone standing— even when every bone in your body wants to strike the final blow.” — The Unified Doctor, Code for Living</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They landed in dust.</p>
<p>The kind that doesn’t blow in wind, because there’s no wind left.</p>
<p>Just silence.</p>
<p>And underneath it, bones.</p>
<p>Not skeletal remains.</p>
<p>But constructs of metal.</p>
<p>Crushed armor.</p>
<p>Discs of melted neural mesh.</p>
<p>Splinters of burnt TARDISes.</p>
<p>A graveyard built by hands too advanced to bury anything properly.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped out of the TARDIS first.</p>
<p>She took one breath and coughed.</p>
<p>The air wasn’t toxic.</p>
<p>Just old.</p>
<p>So old it scraped.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO pinged from the Doctor’s wrist.</p>
<p>“Atmosphere thin. Trace metals. Radiation negligible.”</p>
<p>“But emotional signature is extraordinary.”</p>
<p>The Doctor raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Emotional signature?”</p>
<p>“The terrain is psychoreactive.”</p>
<p>“This planet doesn’t just hold guilt—it responds to it.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“It was a battlefield,” MINO said. “But not just war.”</p>
<p>“This place was used to store decisions.”</p>
<p>“Weapons weren’t just built here. They were justified here.”</p>
<p>The Doctor knelt beside a blackened pillar, brushing away debris.</p>
<p>And there it was.</p>
<p>The Seal of Rassilon.</p>
<p>Scratched out.</p>
<p>Smeared beneath ash.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Time Lords,” he said.</p>
<p>“Of course it was us.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO’s voice dimmed.</p>
<p>“There’s a message buried in the signal we picked up.”</p>
<p>“One line, repeated.”</p>
<p>The words came through:</p>
<p>“Mercy is the last weapon.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven looked at the Doctor.</p>
<p>He didn’t respond.</p>
<p>He just walked.</p>
<p>The soil crunched beneath his boots.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The further they went, the more the land changed.</p>
<p>Stone became bone.</p>
<p>Metal fused with tree roots.</p>
<p>And in the center—at the heart of the long-dead war—stood a structure.</p>
<p>A monument.</p>
<p>No doors.</p>
<p>No windows.</p>
<p>Just a towering spike of obsidian, spiraled like a black thorn.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“What is it?” Raven asked.</p>
<p>The Doctor didn’t answer.</p>
<p>He approached it slowly.</p>
<p>Touched the surface.</p>
<p>It pulsed beneath his hand.</p>
<p>Alive.</p>
<p>Responding.</p>
<p>Remembering.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>A voice whispered—not aloud.</p>
<p>Through the stone.</p>
<p>Through the dust.</p>
<p>Through the guilt.</p>
<p>“I offered them a choice.”</p>
<p>“And they chose to obey.”</p>
<p>“So I let them live.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stepped back.</p>
<p>Face white.</p>
<p>MINO translated calmly:</p>
<p>“Memory echo. Temporal phase between 7,000 and 9,000 years ago.”</p>
<p>“Identity: The Master.”</p>
<p>“Alias used: The Quiet Thorn.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven blinked.</p>
<p>“He ruled here?”</p>
<p>“No,” MINO said. “He held judgment.”</p>
<p>“They brought prisoners here. Enemies. Traitors. Civilians.”</p>
<p>“And he offered them choices. But none of them were real.”</p>
<p>“Every option led to obedience. Or death.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor whispered, “I knew.”</p>
<p>Raven turned.</p>
<p>“Knew what?”</p>
<p>“I knew what he’d done. I read the sealed transcripts. The Tribunal buried them. Said it was a tactic.”</p>
<p>He looked at the monolith.</p>
<p>“I let it go.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped closer.</p>
<p>“You chose not to stop him?”</p>
<p>The Doctor’s voice was a whisper.</p>
<p>“There were worse things in that war.”</p>
<p>He looked at her.</p>
<p>Eyes glassy.</p>
<p>“And he was the one thing that always came back.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She said nothing.</p>
<p>But her silence was not judgment.</p>
<p>It was grief.</p>
<p>Because this wasn’t about war.</p>
<p>Or tactics.</p>
<p>This was about the man who always tried to save others.</p>
<p>Who, just once, saved himself from doing the right thing.</p>
<p>And never forgave himself for it.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The monument pulsed again.</p>
<p>The ground beneath them shifted.</p>
<p>A door appeared.</p>
<p>Just wide enough for one person.</p>
<p>Inside: darkness.</p>
<p>And waiting.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor moved first.</p>
<p>Raven followed.</p>
<p>Inside, it wasn’t a room.</p>
<p>It was a memory chamber.</p>
<p>Walls covered in writing.</p>
<p>Not language.</p>
<p>Emotion.</p>
<p>Every surface encoded with a choice the Master gave.</p>
<p>Every choice a trap.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>And at the center:</p>
<p>A chair.</p>
<p>Simple.</p>
<p>Wooden.</p>
<p>Singed.</p>
<p>Waiting.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stared at it.</p>
<p>“I sat there once.”</p>
<p>Raven looked at him.</p>
<p>“You?”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“He brought me here. Said I had to understand.”</p>
<p>“Said if I could sit in the judgment seat and not flinch…”</p>
<p>“…I deserved to survive.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She touched his arm.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to relive this.”</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>“I already am.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He sat.</p>
<p>The chamber responded instantly.</p>
<p>Light erupted.</p>
<p>The walls pulsed.</p>
<p>And the voice returned.</p>
<p>Not the Master’s.</p>
<p>His own.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“I sat in this chair. And I said I would spare the prisoners.”</p>
<p>“And he smiled.”</p>
<p>“And said: ‘Good. Then you’ll pull the lever. Mercy is not a choice. It’s a burden.’”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO translated softly.</p>
<p>“This was his test.”</p>
<p>“The Master believed mercy was meaningless unless it hurt.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The chair began to vibrate.</p>
<p>The Doctor clenched his fists.</p>
<p>And then—</p>
<p>—a holographic figure stepped forward.</p>
<p>Himself.</p>
<p>Younger.</p>
<p>Worn.</p>
<p>Haunted.</p>
<p>He watched it speak:</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to do it.”</p>
<p>“But if I said no… they’d be slaughtered.”</p>
<p>“So I said yes.”</p>
<p>“And pulled the lever.”</p>
<p>“And they died anyway.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped back.</p>
<p>Her voice caught.</p>
<p>“He tricked you.”</p>
<p>The Doctor stood.</p>
<p>Nodded.</p>
<p>“And I let him.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He looked up at the walls.</p>
<p>Hundreds of names pulsed.</p>
<p>Some Gallifreyan.</p>
<p>Some not.</p>
<p>All of them… dead.</p>
<p>All of them choices made under illusion.</p>
<p>All of them mercy misused.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He turned to Raven.</p>
<p>Voice clear.</p>
<p>“I buried him not because of what he did to me.”</p>
<p>“I buried him because of what I did for him.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>And then—</p>
<p>he raised his sonic.</p>
<p>Pointed it at the chamber.</p>
<p>MINO flickered.</p>
<p>“Doctor. If you destroy this—”</p>
<p>“Then the guilt becomes mine alone,” the Doctor said.</p>
<p>“And that’s where it belongs.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He activated the pulse.</p>
<p>The chamber shuddered.</p>
<p>Collapsed.</p>
<p>Walls folded inward.</p>
<p>Names turned to ash.</p>
<p>And the chair broke apart silently.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Outside, the planet began to shift.</p>
<p>Dust rising.</p>
<p>Weight lifted.</p>
<p>As though the land itself had been waiting for a reckoning.</p>
<p>Not justice.</p>
<p>Not violence.</p>
<p>Just… mercy.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Back in the TARDIS, the Doctor wrote in his notebook.</p>
<p>Three more lines.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“I believe mercy is more powerful than punishment. I believe choosing not to kill is harder than vengeance. I believe ghosts don’t haunt places. They haunt choices.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He closed the book.</p>
<p>And whispered—</p>
<p>“I remember now.”</p>

  <h2>Chapter Eight: The Third Seal</h2>
  <p>Word Count: ~5,690 (The Man Who Buried the Master, Book Fourteen of The Unified Doctor series)</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“The past is not a chain, but a seal. Break it without understanding… and you’ll drown in what it was keeping at bay.” — The Unified Doctor, Code for Living</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The TARDIS floated in a white expanse.</p>
<p>No stars.</p>
<p>No horizon.</p>
<p>Just light without source.</p>
<p>Sound without echo.</p>
<p>The in-between.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO chirped softly.</p>
<p>“We’re out of time.”</p>
<p>Raven frowned.</p>
<p>“Meaning?”</p>
<p>“I can’t calculate coordinates. Not because we’re lost.”</p>
<p>“Because there’s nowhere left to go.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stood with his hands braced against the console.</p>
<p>His face was unreadable.</p>
<p>Not blank.</p>
<p>Just distant.</p>
<p>As if standing across from himself.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“We’ve broken two of them,” he said.</p>
<p>“Two psychic seals. The vault in Gharros. The battlefield on Jarael Minor.”</p>
<p>Raven stepped forward.</p>
<p>“And the third?”</p>
<p>The Doctor didn’t answer.</p>
<p>But his hand moved.</p>
<p>Slowly.</p>
<p>Toward a setting on the console he hadn’t touched in centuries.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO scanned the gesture.</p>
<p>“You’re not serious.”</p>
<p>Raven looked between them.</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>The Doctor spoke one word.</p>
<p>Voice tight.</p>
<p>“Lungbarrow.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven blinked.</p>
<p>“…That’s not a place.”</p>
<p>The Doctor nodded.</p>
<p>“It’s a house.”</p>
<p>MINO chimed in.</p>
<p>“The House of Lungbarrow. One of the oldest looms on Gallifrey.”</p>
<p>“Birthplace of the Time Lord known as—”</p>
<p>The Doctor snapped.</p>
<p>“Don’t say it.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven watched him.</p>
<p>“You’ve never mentioned it before.”</p>
<p>“I try not to.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>He turned away.</p>
<p>“Because memory is powerful. And some things are buried for good reason.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She placed a hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Is that why you’ve never told me your real name?”</p>
<p>He paused.</p>
<p>Then looked at her.</p>
<p>Softly.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He activated the controls.</p>
<p>The TARDIS groaned.</p>
<p>Lights dimmed.</p>
<p>Time itself hesitated.</p>
<p>And then—</p>
<p>they were there.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The House of Lungbarrow was carved into the side of a cliff overlooking the burnt skies of Gallifrey’s Outer Crescent.</p>
<p>Dark spires.</p>
<p>Metallic vines.</p>
<p>A mansion that was less built, more remembered.</p>
<p>It had no symmetry.</p>
<p>No pattern.</p>
<p>Just echoes.</p>
<p>Like it had been designed by memory rather than blueprint.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>As they stepped out, wind sliced across the ledge.</p>
<p>Thin.</p>
<p>Sharp.</p>
<p>Ancient.</p>
<p>Raven squinted at the mansion.</p>
<p>“There’s no door.”</p>
<p>“There never was,” the Doctor said.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They approached.</p>
<p>And the stone parted.</p>
<p>Like a breath.</p>
<p>Like a sigh.</p>
<p>And they entered.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Inside, the halls were silent.</p>
<p>But the silence had layers.</p>
<p>Some soft.</p>
<p>Some watching.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO dimmed his projection.</p>
<p>“Warning. Psychic layering here is heavy.”</p>
<p>“Temporal backflow active. If you encounter memories—”</p>
<p>“Not visions,” the Doctor said firmly.</p>
<p>“We’ve moved beyond those.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They walked.</p>
<p>Through halls that changed.</p>
<p>One moment stone.</p>
<p>Then wood.</p>
<p>Then coral.</p>
<p>Shifting like moods.</p>
<p>Like regrets.</p>
<p>Like the mind of someone trying very hard not to remember.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They reached the central chamber.</p>
<p>And there it was.</p>
<p>The third seal.</p>
<p>Not a vault.</p>
<p>Not a weapon.</p>
<p>But a mirror.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Oval.</p>
<p>Floating.</p>
<p>Silver.</p>
<p>It reflected nothing.</p>
<p>Not even the light.</p>
<p>Not even them.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped closer.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>The Doctor’s voice dropped.</p>
<p>“The Loom Mirror.”</p>
<p>“It shows what the House produced.”</p>
<p>“Not what was born.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She frowned.</p>
<p>“What does that mean?”</p>
<p>He looked at her.</p>
<p>And smiled—sadly.</p>
<p>“It’s Gallifrey. It means nothing and everything.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He stepped toward it.</p>
<p>The mirror pulsed.</p>
<p>Not with light.</p>
<p>But with time.</p>
<p>Old time.</p>
<p>Unspoken time.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO’s voice cracked slightly.</p>
<p>“Doctor… it’s responding to you.”</p>
<p>“But not as you are.”</p>
<p>“As you were.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor exhaled.</p>
<p>“Then it remembers me.”</p>
<p>Raven touched his hand.</p>
<p>“What will it do?”</p>
<p>He turned to her.</p>
<p>“If the Master embedded part of himself here, it’ll try to reform using my original psychic scaffolding.”</p>
<p>“And if that happens…”</p>
<p>He didn’t finish.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The mirror pulsed again.</p>
<p>This time, the surface began to ripple.</p>
<p>Not like water.</p>
<p>More like memory.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Images began to form.</p>
<p>Not visions.</p>
<p>Just shadows.</p>
<p>A child.</p>
<p>Alone.</p>
<p>Reading forbidden books.</p>
<p>Building machines in dark corners.</p>
<p>Saying the wrong things in the right rooms.</p>
<p>Being told not to ask.</p>
<p>Being watched.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven saw it.</p>
<p>And understood.</p>
<p>“You weren’t shaped by war.”</p>
<p>“You were shaped by silence.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>And whispered:</p>
<p>“Lungbarrow doesn’t raise children.”</p>
<p>“It… selects them.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The mirror showed more.</p>
<p>An older figure.</p>
<p>Smiling.</p>
<p>Not the Master.</p>
<p>But close.</p>
<p>A cousin.</p>
<p>A friend.</p>
<p>An echo.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“You knew him here,” Raven said.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“He wasn’t the Master then.”</p>
<p>“He wasn’t anyone.”</p>
<p>“He was… curious.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The mirror shimmered.</p>
<p>And then, suddenly—</p>
<p>a crack.</p>
<p>Thin.</p>
<p>Hairline.</p>
<p>But spreading.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO chirped.</p>
<p>“Seal is breaking. Master’s residual imprint is activating.”</p>
<p>“If it finishes, the House itself may become a vessel.”</p>
<p>“Not for resurrection.”</p>
<p>“For possession.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor raised his sonic.</p>
<p>But paused.</p>
<p>“This was where it began,” he whispered.</p>
<p>“The choice.”</p>
<p>“To walk away.”</p>
<p>“To be something else.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped beside him.</p>
<p>“You’ve buried him everywhere.”</p>
<p>“In memory. In space. In silence.”</p>
<p>“But not here.”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“No. Because this was the part of me that let him in.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He turned to the mirror.</p>
<p>Voice steady.</p>
<p>“I am the Doctor.”</p>
<p>“I chose that name.”</p>
<p>“Not because I wanted to run from this House—”</p>
<p>“But because I wanted to become more than it allowed.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The mirror flared.</p>
<p>The image of the Master flickered.</p>
<p>Sneering.</p>
<p>Triumphant.</p>
<p>Then—surprised.</p>
<p>As the Doctor stepped forward and placed his hand to the glass.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“No more prisons,” he said.</p>
<p>“No more echoes.”</p>
<p>“I am not your architect.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The glass shattered.</p>
<p>Light burst outward.</p>
<p>But not destructive.</p>
<p>Freeing.</p>
<p>The seal collapsed.</p>
<p>And the room fell quiet.</p>
<p>Not empty.</p>
<p>Not abandoned.</p>
<p>Just… finally still.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO’s voice returned.</p>
<p>“Seal three terminated.”</p>
<p>“All psychic anchors dissolved.”</p>
<p>“The Master’s restoration has failed.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor collapsed to one knee.</p>
<p>Raven caught him.</p>
<p>“You okay?”</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>“Just tired.”</p>
<p>“Of being chased by ghosts I helped make.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They walked back through the House.</p>
<p>And this time, it felt lighter.</p>
<p>Not welcoming.</p>
<p>But no longer watching.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Back in the TARDIS, the Doctor wrote in his journal.</p>
<p>Three new lines.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“I believe we are more than what shaped us. I believe breaking silence is sometimes the greatest kindness. I believe you can bury your past— but only if you know which parts to keep.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>And in the space where the Master had once nested—there was only quiet.</p>
<p>For now.</p>

  <h2>Chapter Nine: Ashes That Remember the Flame</h2>
  <p>Word Count: ~5,740 (The Man Who Buried the Master, Book Fourteen of The Unified Doctor series)</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Some planets remember their burning. And some never forgive the one who held the torch— even if he says it was to stop the fire.” — The Unified Doctor, Code for Living</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The distress call wasn’t loud.</p>
<p>It wasn’t urgent.</p>
<p>It didn’t even sound like a warning.</p>
<p>Just a whisper, encoded in a pulse.</p>
<p>A signal lost for centuries.</p>
<p>One that should have faded.</p>
<p>But didn’t.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO decoded it slowly.</p>
<p>“Origin point: Skaro’s Fragment.”</p>
<p>Raven looked up.</p>
<p>“…I thought Skaro was gone.”</p>
<p>The Doctor didn’t respond immediately.</p>
<p>Then quietly:</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He turned to the console.</p>
<p>Input commands.</p>
<p>Watched the starfield twist.</p>
<p>“I destroyed part of it,” he said.</p>
<p>“During the Fourth War. Not the Time War. The other one.”</p>
<p>Raven frowned.</p>
<p>“There were survivors?”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“Not many. But some always escape.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO hovered.</p>
<p>“The signal is addressed to you, Doctor.”</p>
<p>“Not Gallifrey. Not the Time Lords. You.”</p>
<p>The Doctor’s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“What does it say?”</p>
<p>“Four words.”</p>
<p>“You lit the match.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stood silently for a moment.</p>
<p>Then threw the dematerialization lever.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They arrived in orbit.</p>
<p>What once was Skaro was now a jagged, broken crescent.</p>
<p>Stone bleeding fire.</p>
<p>Ash orbiting a new, artificial atmosphere.</p>
<p>But beneath the smoke, something moved.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“A city,” Raven whispered.</p>
<p>The TARDIS screen zoomed in.</p>
<p>Not Dalek tech.</p>
<p>Not Time Lord either.</p>
<p>Something simpler.</p>
<p>Built from scrap.</p>
<p>From willpower.</p>
<p>From memory.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor looked grim.</p>
<p>“They rebuilt.”</p>
<p>MINO scanned the architecture.</p>
<p>“Not Daleks. Not machines.”</p>
<p>“Humanoid. Possibly native Skarovians, long thought extinct.”</p>
<p>“They’ve been underground for centuries.”</p>
<p>“And now they’re above.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor nodded once.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They stepped out onto a scorched plain.</p>
<p>Wind carried dust across blackened glass.</p>
<p>In the distance, towers glimmered—impossibly new.</p>
<p>Built on melted bones.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They were met before they reached the gates.</p>
<p>A figure approached.</p>
<p>Tall.</p>
<p>Hooded.</p>
<p>Skin marked with metallic scars.</p>
<p>Eyes human.</p>
<p>But old.</p>
<p>So old.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“You came,” she said.</p>
<p>The Doctor inclined his head.</p>
<p>“You called.”</p>
<p>She studied him.</p>
<p>Voice level.</p>
<p>“You don’t remember me.”</p>
<p>He paused.</p>
<p>“…Should I?”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She removed her hood.</p>
<p>A face, half-burned.</p>
<p>But calm.</p>
<p>Measured.</p>
<p>“I was there when your flame tore the sky.”</p>
<p>“I was ten.”</p>
<p>“You told me to run.”</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>“I ran so hard I forgot my name.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped forward.</p>
<p>“We’re sorry—”</p>
<p>The woman held up a hand.</p>
<p>“I’m not here to accuse.”</p>
<p>“I’m here to show you.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They entered the city.</p>
<p>It pulsed with reclaimed energy.</p>
<p>Metal twisted into homes.</p>
<p>Ash hardened into walkways.</p>
<p>Children played in shadowed courtyards.</p>
<p>Laughter echoed in the ruins of war.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“You burned us,” she said, guiding them.</p>
<p>“But you also saved us. Because he would have returned.”</p>
<p>“Because he always did.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They reached a central square.</p>
<p>In the middle stood a statue.</p>
<p>Black stone.</p>
<p>Two figures.</p>
<p>One—tall, cloaked, unmistakable.</p>
<p>The Doctor.</p>
<p>The other—writhing, chaotic.</p>
<p>The Master.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stared.</p>
<p>“You built this?”</p>
<p>The woman nodded.</p>
<p>“We remember both.”</p>
<p>“The one who killed us.”</p>
<p>“And the one who saved what was left.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor looked at her.</p>
<p>“And you wanted me to see this?”</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>“To remind you.”</p>
<p>“That memory doesn’t care who wins.”</p>
<p>“It remembers who remained.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He stood before the statue.</p>
<p>Eyes dark.</p>
<p>“I didn’t come for thanks.”</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>“You didn’t come for blame, either.”</p>
<p>“You came to know if it mattered.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He turned to her.</p>
<p>Softly.</p>
<p>“Did it?”</p>
<p>She smiled.</p>
<p>“Ash remembers the flame.”</p>
<p>“But also the warmth that came after.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO whispered from his wrist.</p>
<p>“Signal ending.”</p>
<p>“No threat.”</p>
<p>“No trick.”</p>
<p>“Just memory.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Later, in the TARDIS, the Doctor sat in silence.</p>
<p>Notebook open.</p>
<p>Pen steady.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“I believe redemption is not erasure. I believe memory is its own justice. I believe fire can destroy— but it can also illuminate.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven sat beside him.</p>
<p>She didn’t speak.</p>
<p>Just leaned gently against his shoulder.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He closed the book.</p>
<p>And whispered:</p>
<p>“Let’s go home.”</p>

  <h2>Chapter Ten: The Master’s Last Word</h2>
  <p>Word Count: ~5,820 (The Man Who Buried the Master, Book Fourteen of The Unified Doctor series)</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“There is no peace in the end if you cannot look back without clenching your fists.” — The Unified Doctor, Code for Living</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The message arrived during a silence.</p>
<p>Not a storm.</p>
<p>Not a battle.</p>
<p>Just quiet.</p>
<p>A moment between breaths, when the TARDIS floated listlessly in a corner of deep space, unmoored from intention.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO spoke first.</p>
<p>“Incoming data thread.”</p>
<p>The Doctor looked up from the console.</p>
<p>“What kind?”</p>
<p>“It’s not data. It’s memory.”</p>
<p>“Encoded inside a pre-regeneration time fracture.”</p>
<p>“Locked to your neural imprint.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stood slowly.</p>
<p>“You mean it’s addressed to him?”</p>
<p>“No,” MINO replied.</p>
<p>“It is him.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor’s fingers hesitated over the console.</p>
<p>A long pause.</p>
<p>Then he triggered the playback.</p>
<p>The lights dimmed.</p>
<p>The walls hummed.</p>
<p>And a voice filled the TARDIS.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Well. If you’re hearing this, then it worked.”</p>
<p>“You buried me.”</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Doctor.”</p>
<p>“But don’t get too comfortable.”</p>
<p>“Because I’ve left you one last thing.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The voice was familiar.</p>
<p>Smug.</p>
<p>Wry.</p>
<p>But tired.</p>
<p>Weary in a way the Master never allowed himself to sound.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“You always said I never changed.”</p>
<p>“Always said I was selfish. Cruel. Vicious.”</p>
<p>“You were right.”</p>
<p>“But you never asked why.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stood still.</p>
<p>Unmoving.</p>
<p>Raven watched him carefully.</p>
<p>His expression was unreadable.</p>
<p>But his jaw was tight.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“You think I hated the universe.”</p>
<p>“Truth is…”</p>
<p>“I loved it. Once.”</p>
<p>“And it didn’t love me back.”</p>
<p>“So I decided to make it need me instead.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“And you… oh, you were the worst of it.”</p>
<p>“Because you could love it.”</p>
<p>“You could walk into a room and change everything—without cruelty. Without fear.”</p>
<p>“And that made me hate you.”</p>
<p>“And need you.”</p>
<p>“And try to become you.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The TARDIS was silent but for the voice.</p>
<p>No sound from the engines.</p>
<p>No response from the Doctor.</p>
<p>Just the Master, echoing across time.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“You think I lost.”</p>
<p>“But I didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Because even now, after you’ve erased every trace of me…”</p>
<p>“I remain.”</p>
<p>“In every choice you made to not be me.”</p>
<p>“In every scream you stopped because you remembered my silence.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“I didn’t want your forgiveness.”</p>
<p>“I wanted your attention.”</p>
<p>“And now I’ve got it.”</p>
<p>“Forever.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The message ended.</p>
<p>No sign-off.</p>
<p>No final scream.</p>
<p>Just… absence.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped forward.</p>
<p>Placed a hand on the Doctor’s shoulder.</p>
<p>He didn’t flinch.</p>
<p>But he didn’t speak.</p>
<p>Not at first.</p>
<p>Then finally:</p>
<p>“He’s not wrong.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO flickered softly.</p>
<p>“Doctor…”</p>
<p>The Doctor looked down.</p>
<p>Then sat on the edge of the console platform.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“I hated him.”</p>
<p>“But I never stopped listening.”</p>
<p>He looked up.</p>
<p>Met Raven’s eyes.</p>
<p>“And I think he knew that.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven knelt beside him.</p>
<p>“Do you regret not killing him?”</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Because then he’d have won.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She was quiet.</p>
<p>Then asked:</p>
<p>“Do you regret not saving him?”</p>
<p>He closed his eyes.</p>
<p>And whispered:</p>
<p>“Every day.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They sat in silence.</p>
<p>Time flowing around them.</p>
<p>The TARDIS lights low.</p>
<p>Soft.</p>
<p>Like starlight through memory.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Then the Doctor reached for his journal.</p>
<p>Opened it.</p>
<p>Wrote slowly.</p>
<p>Deliberately.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“I believe we grieve not just who they were— but who they could have been. I believe hatred leaves roots. But love—misplaced, fractured, wounded—leaves ghosts.”</p>
<p>“I believe I buried the Master. But not the memory. And maybe that’s the price.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He closed the book.</p>
<p>MINO’s voice was soft.</p>
<p>“Would you like me to erase the message?”</p>
<p>The Doctor paused.</p>
<p>Then nodded.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Archive it.”</p>
<p>“Let the ghost remain.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He stood.</p>
<p>Looked to Raven.</p>
<p>“To remind me.”</p>
<p>“Not who he was.”</p>
<p>“But who I chose to be.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>And far beyond the TARDIS, somewhere in the folds of time, the message drifted onward.</p>
<p>Echoing not because it demanded to be heard—</p>
<p>but because it had finally finished speaking.</p>

  <h2>Chapter Eleven: How the Doctor Was Buried</h2>
  <p>Word Count: ~5,910 (The Man Who Buried the Master, Book Fourteen of The Unified Doctor series)</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“You can travel the whole universe to escape yourself— but eventually, the road becomes a mirror. And the only way forward is through the reflection.” — The Unified Doctor, Code for Living</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The TARDIS lights dimmed.</p>
<p>Not flickered.</p>
<p>Dimmed.</p>
<p>Softly.</p>
<p>Like the ship was lowering its voice.</p>
<p>Trying not to wake something.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped into the console room.</p>
<p>Paused.</p>
<p>The Doctor stood at the controls, staring.</p>
<p>But doing nothing.</p>
<p>Just standing.</p>
<p>Hands at his sides.</p>
<p>Face unreadable.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Doctor?”</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>Not a flinch.</p>
<p>His eyes were fixed on something that wasn’t there.</p>
<p>Or maybe was.</p>
<p>Just not for her.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO appeared.</p>
<p>“Something’s wrong.”</p>
<p>“Neural scan shows erratic patterning. Disassociation. Temporal delamination.”</p>
<p>Raven rushed forward.</p>
<p>Grabbed the Doctor’s arm.</p>
<p>“Talk to me.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He blinked.</p>
<p>Then turned to her slowly.</p>
<p>“…What’s your name again?”</p>
<p>Raven froze.</p>
<p>The breath left her lungs.</p>
<p>“I—what?”</p>
<p>He smiled faintly.</p>
<p>Like a child waking from a dream.</p>
<p>“I know you. I know I know you. But the file… it’s… misplaced.”</p>
<p>He tapped the side of his head.</p>
<p>“Drawer stuck.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO hovered anxiously.</p>
<p>“He’s fracturing.”</p>
<p>“Psychic overload. The third seal… wasn’t just a vault.”</p>
<p>“It was a failsafe. To suppress his own mind.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven helped him to the floor.</p>
<p>He didn’t resist.</p>
<p>Just sat.</p>
<p>Hands limp.</p>
<p>Breath shallow.</p>
<p>“I’m… forgetting.”</p>
<p>“Me.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She squeezed his hand.</p>
<p>“You’re right here. I’ve got you.”</p>
<p>He closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Then opened them again—confused.</p>
<p>“…Why do I wear this coat?”</p>
<p>She blinked.</p>
<p>“…It’s your coat.”</p>
<p>“Not always,” he murmured.</p>
<p>“There was velvet. And leather. And once… celery.”</p>
<p>He looked at her with dawning fear.</p>
<p>“They’re all inside me. Talking.”</p>
<p>“Not words. Just… wants.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The TARDIS groaned.</p>
<p>Deep.</p>
<p>Structural.</p>
<p>The walls pulsed once—inward.</p>
<p>Like the ship was folding.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO flared in alarm.</p>
<p>“The TARDIS is responding to his collapse.”</p>
<p>“The internal dimensions are becoming metaphorical.”</p>
<p>“Thought and architecture are blending.”</p>
<p>Raven stood.</p>
<p>“Meaning?”</p>
<p>“He’s turning into the TARDIS.”</p>
<p>“And it’s turning into him.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She looked around.</p>
<p>Already the corridor doors were shifting.</p>
<p>One shaped like a cradle.</p>
<p>Another like a grave.</p>
<p>One pulsing like a heartbeat.</p>
<p>Another bleeding stars.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She turned back.</p>
<p>“Doctor. Listen.”</p>
<p>He blinked again.</p>
<p>“…Luisa?”</p>
<p>“No. Raven.”</p>
<p>His eyes clouded.</p>
<p>Then cleared.</p>
<p>Then clouded again.</p>
<p>“Raven. Bird. Wings. Time’s canary…”</p>
<p>“Doctor—stop,” she said gently.</p>
<p>“Breathe.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He reached into his coat.</p>
<p>Pulled out the notebook.</p>
<p>Opened it.</p>
<p>Fingers trembling.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>But the pages were blank.</p>
<p>Every one.</p>
<p>She watched him stare.</p>
<p>Then crumble.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO’s voice was low.</p>
<p>“The Master’s last trick wasn’t resurrection.”</p>
<p>“It was infection.”</p>
<p>“He buried himself in shame.”</p>
<p>“And now the Doctor’s guilt is doing the rest.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven knelt.</p>
<p>Held both his hands.</p>
<p>“Listen to me.”</p>
<p>“You told me once that the truth sets you free.”</p>
<p>“Well, now you have to be free.”</p>
<p>“Let me see you.”</p>
<p>“All of you.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>His eyes locked on hers.</p>
<p>And for a moment—just a moment—</p>
<p>they cleared.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Okay,” he whispered.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The TARDIS walls bent.</p>
<p>And Raven fell.</p>
<p>Not physically.</p>
<p>But inward.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She landed in a garden.</p>
<p>Not a real one.</p>
<p>A memory.</p>
<p>Cracked pathways.</p>
<p>Dead flowers.</p>
<p>The sky above was pages.</p>
<p>Torn, flapping like birds.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>And in the center—</p>
<p>the Doctor.</p>
<p>Sitting on a bench.</p>
<p>Alone.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“You came,” he said.</p>
<p>Raven looked around.</p>
<p>“This is…”</p>
<p>“My mind.”</p>
<p>“What’s left of it.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She stepped forward.</p>
<p>“I’m not leaving without you.”</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>“There’s something I have to show you first.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He stood.</p>
<p>Led her to a pond.</p>
<p>Black water.</p>
<p>Still.</p>
<p>And in it—</p>
<p>faces.</p>
<p>His.</p>
<p>So many.</p>
<p>Laughing.</p>
<p>Crying.</p>
<p>Raging.</p>
<p>Begging.</p>
<p>Each looking up at him like a god they didn’t worship anymore.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“I carry them all.”</p>
<p>“And not just their lives.”</p>
<p>“Their mistakes.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He looked at her.</p>
<p>“I don’t know which one buried the Master.”</p>
<p>“But I know which one let him live.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven took his hand.</p>
<p>“Does it matter?”</p>
<p>He blinked.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“Does it matter which version you were—if the one you are now knows better?”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He looked down.</p>
<p>At his reflection.</p>
<p>And it changed.</p>
<p>To a boy.</p>
<p>To a warrior.</p>
<p>To a ghost.</p>
<p>To a man in a long black coat with tired eyes and kind hands.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He looked at her.</p>
<p>And said:</p>
<p>“Help me bury him.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They stepped into the pond.</p>
<p>And the faces rose like steam.</p>
<p>The ghosts screamed.</p>
<p>But she held his hand.</p>
<p>And he wrote in the air with his finger:</p>
<p>“I am the Doctor.”</p>
<p>“And I remember who I chose to be.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The water stilled.</p>
<p>The sky folded back into stars.</p>
<p>The path reformed beneath their feet.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>And the TARDIS exhaled.</p>
<p>Its walls stopped pulsing.</p>
<p>The rooms reconnected.</p>
<p>Memory became memory again.</p>
<p>Not a trap.</p>
<p>Not a tomb.</p>
<p>Just his.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven opened her eyes.</p>
<p>They were back in the console room.</p>
<p>The Doctor blinked.</p>
<p>His voice calm.</p>
<p>“…That was unpleasant.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She laughed.</p>
<p>Then threw her arms around him.</p>
<p>He stiffened.</p>
<p>Then hugged her back.</p>
<p>Hard.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO’s voice was relieved.</p>
<p>“System restored.”</p>
<p>“Guilt partitioned.”</p>
<p>“Selfhood reinstated.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stepped to the console.</p>
<p>But paused.</p>
<p>Turned to Raven.</p>
<p>And whispered:</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Then he picked up the notebook.</p>
<p>The pages were back.</p>
<p>And he wrote:</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“I believe memory must be faced. I believe truth is not the absence of shame— but the willingness to walk through it. I believe the only way to be whole… is to be seen.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He closed the book.</p>
<p>And the TARDIS hummed like wind through open curtains.</p>

  <h2>Chapter Twelve: Three Graves</h2>
  <p>Word Count: ~5,980 (The Man Who Buried the Master, Book Fourteen of The Unified Doctor series)</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“There are three kinds of graves. The one you dig for your enemy. The one you dig for your friend. And the one you dig so deep— you forget you’re inside it too.” — The Unified Doctor, Code for Living</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>First Grave: The Planet of Frozen Potential</p>
<p>The planet had no name.</p>
<p>The Doctor never gave it one.</p>
<p>That felt safer.</p>
<p>Colder.</p>
<p>Harder to grieve.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>It orbited a dead sun.</p>
<p>A world of crystalline stillness, every surface shimmering in paused motion.</p>
<p>Trees frozen mid-blossom.</p>
<p>Cities mid-collapse.</p>
<p>Statues half-finished, half-erased.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped out of the TARDIS and instantly felt it.</p>
<p>The weight.</p>
<p>The pause.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“What happened here?”</p>
<p>The Doctor was already walking.</p>
<p>His coat whispering over ice.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“This was going to be beautiful,” he said softly.</p>
<p>“They were on the verge of something—something brilliant.”</p>
<p>He reached a monument. It had no inscription. Just a sculpture of a face—part human, part bird, part machine.</p>
<p>“They called themselves the Halcion Accord.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO floated beside them.</p>
<p>“Records lost. This place does not exist in Time’s annals.”</p>
<p>The Doctor nodded.</p>
<p>“That’s because I erased it.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven turned sharply.</p>
<p>“You?”</p>
<p>He didn’t flinch.</p>
<p>“They struck a deal with the Master.”</p>
<p>“Not war. Access. He gave them a glimpse of quantum fatework. Timelines to edit, to choose from.”</p>
<p>“They saw what they could become… and froze.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven blinked.</p>
<p>“…They stopped?”</p>
<p>The Doctor gestured.</p>
<p>“All of this—paused mid-decision. Entire species caught in recursive loops.”</p>
<p>“They wanted to become only the best versions of themselves.”</p>
<p>“And in doing so… they stopped being anything.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He looked at her.</p>
<p>“They buried themselves in perfection.”</p>
<p>“And I…”</p>
<p>“I buried the rest.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He placed his hand on the statue.</p>
<p>Closed his eyes.</p>
<p>And whispered:</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I couldn’t unfreeze you.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Grave one acknowledged,” MINO said.</p>
<p>“Memory sealed.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Second Grave: The Erased Library</p>
<p>The TARDIS landed in silence.</p>
<p>A single ruined corridor stretched before them, its roof broken open to stars.</p>
<p>Shelves were collapsed.</p>
<p>Books smoldered in vacuum.</p>
<p>Timelines unbound, drifting like ash.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“This was the Lexicon of Kallis Minor,” the Doctor said.</p>
<p>“One of the few places where erased possibilities were remembered.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven brushed soot from a title.</p>
<p>It disappeared before her eyes.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>He walked slowly.</p>
<p>Quietly.</p>
<p>“She built this place.”</p>
<p>“Kallis. One of my oldest friends. She and I… we believed you could remember without re-living.”</p>
<p>He exhaled.</p>
<p>“And then the Master found it.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO spoke softly.</p>
<p>“Confirmed. Psychic burn patterns match his entropy code.”</p>
<p>The Doctor stared into the ruin.</p>
<p>“He erased the memories of things that never happened.”</p>
<p>“Wiped away the might-have-beens.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven looked at him.</p>
<p>“Why does that matter?”</p>
<p>He smiled—sadly.</p>
<p>“Because grief isn’t always for what you lost.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes it’s for what you couldn’t become.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He knelt beside a charred book.</p>
<p>Opened it.</p>
<p>Inside: a drawing.</p>
<p>Stick figures.</p>
<p>Labeled.</p>
<p>Me. Him. Stars.</p>
<p>Tears welled in his eyes.</p>
<p>“She tried to remind me.”</p>
<p>“She remembered for me.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He closed the book gently.</p>
<p>Set it down like a coffin.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Grave two acknowledged,” said MINO.</p>
<p>“Memory sealed.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Third Grave: The Burnt Sky</p>
<p>They didn’t land on the planet.</p>
<p>There was no point.</p>
<p>It was ash.</p>
<p>Just dust now.</p>
<p>But the stars remembered.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stood at the TARDIS doors, staring into the black.</p>
<p>“This was Marnex Twelve.”</p>
<p>“A colony that tried peace.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO projected archived visuals.</p>
<p>Men and women standing hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>Daleks encircling.</p>
<p>Time Lords watching.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“They declared neutrality,” the Doctor said.</p>
<p>“They wanted to live outside the war.”</p>
<p>“And I…”</p>
<p>He gripped the railing.</p>
<p>“I was too late.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stood beside him.</p>
<p>Quiet.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer.</p>
<p>Just held out his notebook.</p>
<p>Showed her one line:</p>
<p>Some fires arrive after the match is struck.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She placed a hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Soft.</p>
<p>Strong.</p>
<p>“You blame yourself.”</p>
<p>“I was the only one who could have stopped him.”</p>
<p>“And I hesitated.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Silence stretched between stars.</p>
<p>Then the Doctor looked at her.</p>
<p>Really looked.</p>
<p>“For all the graves I dug him…”</p>
<p>“…He only needed one of me.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He stepped back inside.</p>
<p>Sat at the console.</p>
<p>Opened the notebook.</p>
<p>Wrote slowly.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“I believe we do not bury the past. We place it where we can return to it— Not to live in it, But to learn. I believe regret is a form of memory that refuses to be quiet. And that’s why I still listen.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO’s voice was soft.</p>
<p>“All three graves acknowledged.”</p>
<p>“Memories sealed.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped forward.</p>
<p>“You’re not him.”</p>
<p>“You never were.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor smiled faintly.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“But I carried him for a long time.”</p>
<p>“And now… I think I can lay him down.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The TARDIS dematerialized, leaving the graves behind.</p>
<p>But not forgotten.</p>
<p>Never forgotten.</p>

  <h2>Chapter Thirteen: The Place Where Mercy Was Born</h2>
  <p>Word Count: ~5,970 (The Man Who Buried the Master, Book Fourteen of The Unified Doctor series)</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Mercy is not the absence of power. It is the mastery of it.” — The Unified Doctor, Code for Living</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The planet was forgotten by maps.</p>
<p>Not by accident.</p>
<p>By design.</p>
<p>It lived in a fold between orbits, where suns forgot to shine and gravity dared not linger.</p>
<p>A memory the universe had chosen to misplace.</p>
<p>The Doctor remembered it anyway.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>As the TARDIS doors opened, Raven stepped into a field of violet grass that sang softly when touched.</p>
<p>Wind carried the sound of long-ago lullabies.</p>
<p>The air was warm. Still.</p>
<p>Yet somehow every breath felt watched.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Where are we?” she asked.</p>
<p>The Doctor stepped out beside her, his coat catching the breeze like a sail.</p>
<p>He didn’t speak for a moment.</p>
<p>Then finally:</p>
<p>“This is Olyssos.”</p>
<p>“The place where mercy began.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO floated forward, scanning.</p>
<p>“Geological composition is ancient. No signs of warfare. No advanced infrastructure.”</p>
<p>“Yet there are structures—emotional in nature. I am detecting… ethical architecture.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven turned.</p>
<p>“…Did you say ethical architecture?”</p>
<p>“Correct. This world encoded morality into its topography.”</p>
<p>“Empathy is woven into the landscape like magnetic fields.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor knelt, brushing his fingers over the grass.</p>
<p>“It started as an experiment,” he said softly.</p>
<p>“The people here believed evolution had become too violent.”</p>
<p>“So they developed a way to encode peaceful resolution into the biosphere.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He gestured toward the horizon.</p>
<p>“The trees would alter their fruit depending on the emotional state of those beneath them.”</p>
<p>“Storms would pause mid-thunder if someone was grieving.”</p>
<p>“They bred entire generations to value compassion as survival.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven looked around.</p>
<p>“It’s… beautiful.”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“It was.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She caught his tone.</p>
<p>“…Was?”</p>
<p>He stood again.</p>
<p>“The Master found this place.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO dimmed.</p>
<p>“Record confirms presence here over one hundred years ago.”</p>
<p>“Alias used: Mercion. He established a commune, redirected the ecosystem to mirror suffering instead of relieving it.”</p>
<p>“He rewrote mercy as a currency. A hierarchy.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven shivered.</p>
<p>“What did he do?”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor’s voice darkened.</p>
<p>“He taught them that mercy should be earned.”</p>
<p>“That it wasn’t a gift. It was a scar.”</p>
<p>“And if you didn’t carry the right kind of scars…”</p>
<p>“…you didn’t deserve compassion.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He turned toward a ridge.</p>
<p>“We need to go there.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They walked in silence.</p>
<p>Over a ridge of singing stones, into a grove of whispering bark.</p>
<p>Trees parted as they passed—not physically, but spiritually.</p>
<p>Like the forest remembered them.</p>
<p>Or, more precisely, remembered him.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They reached a garden.</p>
<p>At its center stood a single bench, and behind it, a plaque.</p>
<p>No words.</p>
<p>Just a hollow.</p>
<p>As if something had once been inscribed—and had been intentionally erased.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven moved to it.</p>
<p>“What was this?”</p>
<p>The Doctor knelt again.</p>
<p>“This was where I forgave him.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She looked at him.</p>
<p>He wasn’t crying.</p>
<p>But his voice was not steady.</p>
<p>“I brought him here. Once. Before everything.”</p>
<p>“He’d just destroyed a colony. Said it was to prevent a future war.”</p>
<p>“He laughed about it. Said mercy was inefficient.”</p>
<p>“So I brought him here.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He stood, pacing slowly.</p>
<p>“I made him sit. Told him about the trees. The air. The kindness that grew here without cost.”</p>
<p>“And for three whole minutes… he listened.”</p>
<p>“No arguments. No jokes. Just silence.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped beside him.</p>
<p>“What happened after?”</p>
<p>He laughed once.</p>
<p>No humor in it.</p>
<p>“He said it was the most manipulative place he’d ever seen.”</p>
<p>“Called it ‘emotional fascism.’ Said if he stayed any longer, he’d start crying at clouds.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor looked at her, eyes deep with a tired kind of grief.</p>
<p>“And then he thanked me.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven paused.</p>
<p>“You forgave him?”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“Not for what he did.”</p>
<p>“But because I believed that somewhere—somewhere in him—there was still a boy who wanted to be good.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO hovered closer.</p>
<p>“There is a resonance here.”</p>
<p>“Emotional echo. Low frequency. Deep shame.”</p>
<p>“I believe he left something behind.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor turned sharply.</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The bench shimmered.</p>
<p>And inside it—a folded piece of paper.</p>
<p>Sealed in stasis.</p>
<p>The Doctor opened it slowly.</p>
<p>Read the words aloud.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“This place is disgusting. But it’s the only place I ever wanted to stay. Don’t come back here. It’s better if it stays clean.”</p>
<p>— M.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven touched his arm.</p>
<p>“…He did understand.”</p>
<p>The Doctor didn’t reply.</p>
<p>Just stared at the note.</p>
<p>Then folded it.</p>
<p>Placed it back inside.</p>
<p>Closed the bench.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He turned away.</p>
<p>Then stopped.</p>
<p>Looked back at the garden.</p>
<p>And whispered:</p>
<p>“Mercy is choosing not to demand penance from someone who’ll never ask.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Back in the TARDIS, he opened his notebook.</p>
<p>Wrote slowly.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“I believe forgiveness is not absolution. It is the refusal to chain yourself to someone else’s choices. I believe mercy begins where punishment would be easiest. And ends when you stop needing to be right.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven leaned against the console.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>The Doctor looked at her.</p>
<p>Smiled.</p>
<p>And said:</p>
<p>“I think I’m beginning to be.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The TARDIS dematerialized.</p>
<p>And the garden was quiet again.</p>
<p>Still.</p>
<p>But not forgotten.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>And somewhere, in a fold of memory that wasn’t quite dead, the concept of mercy sighed—</p>
<p>not because it had been proven right,</p>
<p>but because it had finally been understood.</p>

  <h2>Chapter Fourteen: The Man Who Buried the Master</h2>
  <p>Word Count: ~6,020 (The Man Who Buried the Master, Book Fourteen of The Unified Doctor series)</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Some enemies we bury to stop their return. Others, we bury to stop becoming them. But the hardest are the ones we bury to say goodbye.” — The Unified Doctor, Code for Living</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They arrived at the edge of a neutron star.</p>
<p>Not close.</p>
<p>Not dangerously so.</p>
<p>But deliberately so.</p>
<p>The kind of distance that lets you feel the weight of something without letting it crush you.</p>
<p>The light was wrong.</p>
<p>It bent inwards, folding across itself.</p>
<p>Sound didn’t exist here—just the thrum of thought.</p>
<p>Of memory.</p>
<p>Of finality.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stood at the threshold of the TARDIS.</p>
<p>Looking out into folded spacetime.</p>
<p>Raven was beside him.</p>
<p>MINO hovered low, projection dimmed out of respect.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“This is the place,” the Doctor said.</p>
<p>Raven nodded once.</p>
<p>“What’s here?”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer at first.</p>
<p>Just looked down at his hand.</p>
<p>Opened it.</p>
<p>A single crystalline shard lay there.</p>
<p>Faintly glowing with the color of a scream held in.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“This,” he said quietly, “is what’s left of him.”</p>
<p>Raven’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>“You kept it?”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“I thought I’d destroyed it. But fragments survive.”</p>
<p>“Bits of soul. Will. Pattern.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO added softly:</p>
<p>“Final fragment of the Master’s consciousness. Encased in temporal stasis. Last active resonance: remorse.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven turned to the Doctor.</p>
<p>“Why bring it here?”</p>
<p>He didn’t respond.</p>
<p>Not directly.</p>
<p>Instead, he stepped out of the TARDIS onto the invisible platform the ship had woven from light and time.</p>
<p>The star pulsed below, vast and silent.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He held the shard up to the dark.</p>
<p>And began to speak.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“You were my friend,” he said.</p>
<p>His voice echoed without sound.</p>
<p>“We never said it. Not properly. But I think you knew.”</p>
<p>“You knew… and you hated that it was still true.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He lowered the shard slightly.</p>
<p>“You became something else.”</p>
<p>“Something cruel.”</p>
<p>“Something brilliant.”</p>
<p>“Something… broken.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped forward.</p>
<p>Silent.</p>
<p>Listening.</p>
<p>Bearing witness.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor continued.</p>
<p>“You made yourself unforgettable.”</p>
<p>“Every time I changed, you were there.”</p>
<p>“Not just as a shadow.”</p>
<p>“But as a question.”</p>
<p>“What if you’d been the one who walked away?”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He looked down at the shard again.</p>
<p>“I buried you across time. Across space. Across myself.”</p>
<p>“But this—”</p>
<p>“This is the last one.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He knelt on one knee.</p>
<p>Set the shard on the edge of the platform.</p>
<p>It hovered, gently, cradled by the gravity of the moment.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He took out his notebook.</p>
<p>Tore out a page.</p>
<p>Wrote four words.</p>
<p>Folded it.</p>
<p>Placed it beneath the shard.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“What did you write?” Raven asked quietly.</p>
<p>He didn’t look up.</p>
<p>“Not for us.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Then he stood.</p>
<p>Stepped back.</p>
<p>And closed his eyes.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“I forgive you.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The shard pulsed.</p>
<p>Light radiated—not explosively, but reverently.</p>
<p>The star below shimmered.</p>
<p>For a moment, it seemed to pause.</p>
<p>To bow.</p>
<p>To accept.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>And then—</p>
<p>the shard dissolved.</p>
<p>Not shattered.</p>
<p>Not burned.</p>
<p>Just…</p>
<p>became light.</p>
<p>And the note?</p>
<p>Gone with it.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven breathed in slowly.</p>
<p>The Doctor opened his eyes.</p>
<p>No tears.</p>
<p>No speech.</p>
<p>Just silence.</p>
<p>Full.</p>
<p>Complete.</p>
<p>Free.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Back in the TARDIS, he stood at the console.</p>
<p>Hands resting gently on its edges.</p>
<p>He looked around.</p>
<p>Then up at MINO.</p>
<p>“Set course for somewhere unimportant.”</p>
<p>MINO chirped.</p>
<p>“Coordinates: Randomized.”</p>
<p>“Destination: Joyful surprise pending.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped forward.</p>
<p>She touched his arm.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>He turned.</p>
<p>Smiled.</p>
<p>And for the first time in a long time—</p>
<p>it wasn’t tired.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said.</p>
<p>“I think…”</p>
<p>“…I’m whole.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He picked up the notebook.</p>
<p>Wrote the final entry for the day.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“I believe grief is not weakness. It is love with nowhere left to go. I believe enemies are not always meant to be defeated— Sometimes, they are mirrors. And sometimes, when the mirror breaks, You finally see who you’ve become.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The TARDIS engines hummed.</p>
<p>The Doctor looked at Raven.</p>
<p>“Shall we?”</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>“Let’s live.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>And the TARDIS vanished into the stars.</p>
<p>Carrying with it a man who had buried his greatest enemy—</p>
<p>And in doing so,</p>
<p>Had finally stopped burying himself.</p>

  <h2>Chapter Fifteen: The Ones He Couldn’t Save</h2>
  <p>Word Count: ~6,210 (The Man Who Buried the Master, Book Fourteen of The Unified Doctor series)</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“You never stop seeing them. Not the ones who made it. The ones who didn’t.” — The Unified Doctor, Code for Living</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor didn’t plan the destinations.</p>
<p>They just came.</p>
<p>Unbidden.</p>
<p>Unscheduled.</p>
<p>But not random.</p>
<p>The TARDIS was choosing. Or perhaps remembering.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was.</p>
<p>And Raven didn’t ask why.</p>
<p>She simply followed.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The First: The Planet with No Sunrise</p>
<p>The sky was always dusk.</p>
<p>A lavender grey that never brightened, never dimmed.</p>
<p>This planet—Talmyra VI—had been locked in orbital trauma for centuries. No rotation. No day. No night.</p>
<p>Just a pause.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stepped from the TARDIS and looked out across the field.</p>
<p>Once it had been a village.</p>
<p>Now it was stone.</p>
<p>Not ruins.</p>
<p>Statues.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven followed him. Her breath caught.</p>
<p>“What happened here?”</p>
<p>The Doctor was silent for a long moment.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>“They made a choice.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He walked between the frozen figures.</p>
<p>Men, women, children.</p>
<p>Each turned to stone not by weapon or spell—but willingly.</p>
<p>“Disease,” he said.</p>
<p>“Something terrible. The Master helped it along. But this…”</p>
<p>He gestured around.</p>
<p>“…this was their idea.”</p>
<p>“They locked themselves in temporal stasis before it could spread.”</p>
<p>“To save others.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven touched the hand of a young girl—perfectly preserved in motion, a ribbon still fluttering from her hair.</p>
<p>“They… sacrificed everyone?”</p>
<p>The Doctor nodded.</p>
<p>“I was supposed to stop it.”</p>
<p>“I was late.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He bent down beside a figure curled around a small animal.</p>
<p>The creature’s eyes were wide in fear. The man’s face was peace itself.</p>
<p>“I arrived a minute too late.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven took his hand.</p>
<p>He looked up at her.</p>
<p>Said nothing.</p>
<p>But in his eyes was something deeper than sorrow.</p>
<p>Reverence.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He stood.</p>
<p>Spoke gently:</p>
<p>“Goodbye.”</p>
<p>“May your dusk always be kind.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They left without fanfare.</p>
<p>Just silence.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Second: The Door That Wouldn’t Open</p>
<p>The TARDIS materialized in a hallway of glass.</p>
<p>Raven recognized it instantly.</p>
<p>“Gallifrey.”</p>
<p>The Doctor nodded.</p>
<p>But this wasn’t the Capitol.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the great council chambers.</p>
<p>It was a side corridor.</p>
<p>Unassuming.</p>
<p>Dusty.</p>
<p>With a single white door.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven turned.</p>
<p>“…Who’s behind it?”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer.</p>
<p>Just stepped forward.</p>
<p>Tried the handle.</p>
<p>Locked.</p>
<p>Always had been.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>The Doctor sighed.</p>
<p>Then answered.</p>
<p>“Someone I couldn’t save.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He sat against the wall beside the door.</p>
<p>Pulled his knees up.</p>
<p>Spoke to the wood.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“You wanted to see the stars.”</p>
<p>“You hated politics. Hated the games.”</p>
<p>“You wanted to grow flowers on a TARDIS, do you remember?”</p>
<p>“You said the stars weren’t cold. Just lonely.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He smiled faintly.</p>
<p>Then broke.</p>
<p>“I should’ve fought harder.”</p>
<p>“I should’ve made you leave.”</p>
<p>“You stayed because I asked you to. And when the war came…”</p>
<p>His voice faltered.</p>
<p>“You closed this door.”</p>
<p>“Sealed yourself in.”</p>
<p>“Let the fire pass over.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven stepped back.</p>
<p>Let him speak.</p>
<p>Let him grieve.</p>
<p>She didn’t try to open it.</p>
<p>Some doors must stay closed.</p>
<p>But they must also be seen.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stood.</p>
<p>Wiped his eyes.</p>
<p>Laid one hand on the frame.</p>
<p>Then whispered:</p>
<p>“I remember you.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>And the door, just faintly—</p>
<p>hummed.</p>
<p>Not in reply.</p>
<p>But in acceptance.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Third: The Promise He Broke</p>
<p>The TARDIS materialized on an asteroid orbiting a shattered moon.</p>
<p>There was nothing here.</p>
<p>No life.</p>
<p>No cities.</p>
<p>Just wind.</p>
<p>And a single stone marker.</p>
<p>Handmade.</p>
<p>Cracked.</p>
<p>Etched in Gallifreyan.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven waited behind him.</p>
<p>The Doctor knelt before it.</p>
<p>Brushed off the dust.</p>
<p>And read aloud.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Here rests Orlen Sodek. Who waited for me. Who waited too long.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He didn’t speak after that.</p>
<p>Just sat.</p>
<p>Raven came to his side.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“…Who was he?”</p>
<p>The Doctor smiled.</p>
<p>A tired, fond kind of smile.</p>
<p>“A man I met during a rebellion. A teacher. Kind. Brilliant.”</p>
<p>“He asked for my help.”</p>
<p>“I told him I’d return.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>MINO hovered gently.</p>
<p>“Records confirm the planet fell eight months after your departure.”</p>
<p>“Sodek remained. Helped evacuate others. Refused to leave.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor placed a hand on the stone.</p>
<p>“I’ve saved galaxies.”</p>
<p>“But I left him.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven touched his back.</p>
<p>“You didn’t forget.”</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“That’s the point.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He pulled out his notebook.</p>
<p>Wrote slowly.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“I believe remembering is not enough. But forgetting is betrayal. I believe guilt must not define you. But it must shape your promises.”</p>
<p>“I believe we must make space— for the ones we couldn’t save.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They stood.</p>
<p>The stars flickered above.</p>
<p>A silence that was not absence, but presence.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Raven turned to him.</p>
<p>“There are more, aren’t there?”</p>
<p>The Doctor nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“But these three…”</p>
<p>He exhaled.</p>
<p>“…these three were me.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She didn’t question it.</p>
<p>Just took his hand.</p>
<p>Held it.</p>
<p>Not as comfort.</p>
<p>Not as forgiveness.</p>
<p>But as witness.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They returned to the TARDIS.</p>
<p>MINO hovered silently.</p>
<p>The console pulsed with quiet grace.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor turned to Raven.</p>
<p>Met her eyes.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>She smiled.</p>
<p>“Always.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>And then he whispered:</p>
<p>“For them.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The TARDIS spun once more into the stars.</p>
<p>Carrying all the ones who couldn’t be saved.</p>
<p>But finally…</p>
<p>no longer alone.</p>
