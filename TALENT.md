## Extended Audition Script

### Narrator
1. *“The TARDIS landed with a sound like a sigh, as if the ship itself knew the danger waiting outside. The air around it shimmered faintly, like heat rising from stone, though the ground was cold. Worlds hold their breath at moments like this, when something old and powerful arrives to disturb the silence.”*  

2. *“The Doctor stepped out, coat brushing the threshold, eyes sharp but unreadable. Beside him, the night was vast. Shadows stretched long and thin, bending in ways shadows should not bend. This was not a place of safety. It was a crossroads of fate, where choices would echo long after footsteps faded.”*  

3. *“The land itself seemed alive. Stones whispered as if memory had been etched into their cracks. The wind carried no scent, only questions. And above them all, a sky that refused to move — locked in a single endless twilight. Even the stars seemed reluctant to shine.”*  

4. *“Yet within that unease was a spark of wonder. For even in fear, there is discovery. Even in the unknown, there is story. The Doctor’s journeys were not measured in safety, but in how deeply they cut into the marrow of time. Every silence was a prelude, every pause the intake of a universe about to speak.”*  

5. *“And somewhere, beyond sight but not beyond reach, something was listening. Waiting. Patient, ancient, and hungry. The Doctor had felt it before — the thrum of a predator story, a trap laid not with chains, but with narrative. Tonight, the world itself was the snare.”*

### Companion
1. *“Doctor, that door wasn’t there a moment ago. I swear it. I turned, and it was just wall — cold, stone, nothing unusual. But now… it’s breathing. The wood isn’t still, it shifts, like lungs beneath a ribcage. I don’t like it. I don’t like it one bit.”*  

2. *“You always say not to worry, that fear is just the body’s way of telling us to pay attention. Well, my body is screaming at me right now. Look closer — the handle is glistening, like it’s been touched by hands that shouldn’t exist anymore. It’s warm. Too warm. Nothing in this place should be warm.”*  

3. *“What happens if we open it? No, don’t grin at me like that, I know you’re going to. You can’t resist a mystery. But sometimes mysteries are locked away for a reason. Sometimes they’re not puzzles. They’re warnings. And I’m not sure I’m ready to find out which this is.”*  

4. *“Still… if you step forward, you know I’ll follow. That’s what I signed up for, isn’t it? To be the one who walks into the dark with you, even when my heart is pounding, even when every instinct screams to run. Because if I don’t, who will?”*  

5. *“Just promise me something. If we open it, if something comes through… don’t let it take me. Don’t let it rewrite who I am. Because standing here, looking at that door, I feel like I could be unmade in a single breath.”*

### Villain
1. *“You think time is your ally, Doctor. But time rots. It corrodes. It leaves behind only the bitter metal taste of what was lost. I have walked through centuries where empires forgot their own names. I have seen suns die, not in flame, but in silence. And still, I remain.”*  

2. *“Do you know what that makes me? Not a conqueror. Not a tyrant. Those are fleeting. It makes me the rot that grows beneath memory. The mold that spreads when no one is watching. I am what persists after glory has been scrubbed away by the centuries. I am inevitability, wearing the mask of flesh.”*  

3. *“You call yourself a healer, a wanderer, a savior. But you leave ruins behind you, Doctor. I have counted them. Worlds that bent beneath your shadow and never stood again. I am their witness. Their chronicler. Their avenger. And now, I will make you kneel before the graves you dug.”*  

4. *“Listen to the silence, Doctor. That is the sound of victory. No cheers, no celebration — just the absence of resistance. That is the universe as I will shape it: obedient, ordered, stripped of the chaos you pretend is hope. You believe in free will. I believe in correction.”*  

5. *“And when the last star flickers and dies, when all stories have been erased but mine, you will remember me. Not as a monster, not as a foe, but as the final word the cosmos ever spoke. I will not just end time. I will sign my name across its ashes.”*
