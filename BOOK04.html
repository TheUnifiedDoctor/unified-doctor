  <h2>Chapter One: The Laughing Moon</h2>
  <p>⸻</p>
<p>The TARDIS landed with a soft chime, the usual wheezing vworp-vworp exchanged for a sound like wind chimes fluttering in a spring breeze.</p>
<p>It stood at the edge of a hill, beneath a violet sky pricked with gold. Below, in the valley, the crystalline city of Miridell shimmered like a jewel on a spinning plate.</p>
<p>Tents spiralled like ribbons of flame. Ferris wheels spun with prismatic spokes. Glass walkways caught the sun and threw it skyward. And everywhere — laughter.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Inside the TARDIS, the Doctor was halfway into a patchwork coat he’d clearly just rediscovered in the wardrobe.</p>
<p>It was long, dramatic, and somehow looked like it belonged on the cover of a circus poster.</p>
<p>Ava leaned against the console, arms crossed.</p>
<p>“You look like a piñata at a tea party.”</p>
<p>“Excellent!” the Doctor grinned, tugging the final sleeve. “Then I’m dressed appropriately. This moon hasn’t hosted the Carnival in a thousand years. The Crystal Conclave only aligns when the three suns converge at the solstice apex. Quite rare. Quite beautiful. Quite… disruptive.”</p>
<p>Anna poked her head around the corner, brushing dust off her sleeves. “Disruptive how?”</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing dreadful,” the Doctor said breezily. “Reality gets frilly.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Cal stepped out of the armory with a water bottle and a look that said “Why am I dressed for a parade?” He wore a blue vest with tiny silver bells stitched into the trim.</p>
<p>“No weapons?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No need!” the Doctor beamed. “Miridell is a neutral joy zone. Harm is psychically filtered through the moon’s refractive lattice.”</p>
<p>“…The what now?”</p>
<p>“If you try to punch someone, you end up apologising and offering them cake.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They stepped outside.</p>
<p>The air was warm. The ground beneath their feet sparkled like crushed pearls.</p>
<p>At the base of the hill, music drifted upward — strings, whistles, and a pipe-organ calliope playing a song that made your ribs tingle.</p>
<p>Anna laughed before she realised it, then clapped a hand over her mouth.</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” the Doctor said, glancing skyward. “Just… don’t laugh too much.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They reached the carnival gates.</p>
<p>A towering arch of red glass shimmered into place as they approached.</p>
<p>A mechanical figure bowed from the entry post — thin as a reed, with eyes like kaleidoscopes.</p>
<p>“Welcome to the Carnival of Glass,” it intoned. “Laughter is currency. Joy is tribute. Mirrors reveal the soul.”</p>
<p>Then it bowed again.</p>
<p>Its smile never moved.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Ava leaned in.</p>
<p>“I don’t like how it didn’t blink.”</p>
<p>“Mirrors never do,” the Doctor said quietly.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Inside, the carnival was breathtaking.</p>
<p>Tents of translucent silk billowed without wind.</p>
<p>Stilt walkers made entirely of suspended crystal limbs marched in perfect unison.</p>
<p>Sweets were sold in floating orbs, bursting with clouds of colour when touched.</p>
<p>But the mirrors… were wrong.</p>
<p>They didn’t reflect what was there.</p>
<p>They reflected what you wanted to see.</p>
<p>Cal’s showed a uniform he’d left behind.</p>
<p>Ava’s showed a small flat on Earth, clean and quiet.</p>
<p>Anna’s… showed nothing at all.</p>
<p>Just an empty field of stars.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor’s mirror shimmered violently — the image struggling, as though trying to settle on one identity out of too many.</p>
<p>He turned away before it could finish.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Then a scream cut through the air.</p>
<p>One of the acrobats dropped from mid-air — not falling, but folding, like a piece of paper being turned inside out.</p>
<p>The laughter around them did not stop.</p>
<p>No one screamed.</p>
<p>No one noticed.</p>
<p>Except the Doctor.</p>
<p>And the child in the corner, watching with wide, hollow eyes.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“There,” the Doctor whispered.</p>
<p>“Something’s feeding.”</p>

<section class="chapter" id="ch-02-chapter-two-the-jesters-smile">
  <h2>Chapter Two: The Jester’s Smile</h2>
  <p>⸻</p>
<p>The child was gone.</p>
<p>Vanished between moments.</p>
<p>One second, the little boy was staring up from the base of the glass trapeze tower, eyes wide as moons, mouth slightly open. The next — nothing but wind, and a single silver balloon drifting upward.</p>
<p>The Doctor stared for a long moment, the tips of his fingers brushing his lips.</p>
<p>“That’s the second disappearance I’ve seen in as many minutes,” he murmured. “And no one’s even blinking.”</p>
<p>Cal moved forward, scanning the crowd. “I see families. Performers. Locals. But it’s like they didn’t notice the kid vanish. Like their memories… skipped.”</p>
<p>“Selective dissonance,” Ava said grimly. “The kind you get when you’re inside something more powerful than a perception filter. Like being edited from your own dreams.”</p>
<p>Anna didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>Because something was whispering.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>She turned slowly.</p>
<p>A path of mirrors lined the lane beside the candyfloss spiral.</p>
<p>Each mirror slightly warped.</p>
<p>Each showing slightly different reflections.</p>
<p>The third one showed someone in the background — a person standing beside Anna’s reflection.</p>
<p>A man.</p>
<p>Dressed in motley silks and checkerboard trousers.</p>
<p>Face painted in long white lines, mouth frozen in a jagged grin.</p>
<p>As Anna turned to look behind her—</p>
<p>—he was already there.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Hello, Little Ghost,” the jester said, crouching down to eye level. His voice was a soft, velvet rasp — not threatening. But not human, either.</p>
<p>Anna froze.</p>
<p>“I’m not a ghost.”</p>
<p>“Not anymore,” he replied. “But parts of you… still echo. Especially in the funhouse.”</p>
<p>His grin widened.</p>
<p>“Mirrors remember.”</p>
<p>“Even when people don’t.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor appeared beside her, a hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Pardon me,” he said politely. “But who are you, exactly, and why are you trying to scare my friend?”</p>
<p>The jester blinked.</p>
<p>Slowly.</p>
<p>Deliberately.</p>
<p>“I am Carnavas, Harlequin of the Hollow Carnival.”</p>
<p>“And this moon is no longer your friend.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He vanished.</p>
<p>Not in a swirl of smoke or a burst of light.</p>
<p>He just wasn’t there anymore.</p>
<p>No displacement. No teleport signature. No trace.</p>
<p>Anna stared at the mirror.</p>
<p>Where her reflection still stood.</p>
<p>But she wasn’t in front of it.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Later, at the Laughter Wells.</p>
<p>The wells were pools of refracted energy where laughter was harvested, processed, and dispersed into the crystal lattice of the moon.</p>
<p>Joy as energy.</p>
<p>A clean, renewable source.</p>
<p>Theoretically.</p>
<p>The Doctor inspected the nearest one.</p>
<p>The glass beneath his fingers pulsed — but the laughter inside was wrong.</p>
<p>Not joyous.</p>
<p>Forced.</p>
<p>Echoing with a rhythm too precise to be real.</p>
<p>“These wells aren’t collecting laughter,” he said aloud.</p>
<p>“They’re manufacturing it.”</p>
<p>Ava frowned. “But why?”</p>
<p>“Because something’s feeding,” the Doctor said.</p>
<p>“And it doesn’t want reality.”</p>
<p>“It wants a performance.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Cal had found the first real witness.</p>
<p>A carnival glass-crafter named Selin, whose daughter had vanished the previous morning.</p>
<p>“She went into the House of Many Faces,” Selin said, trembling.</p>
<p>“She never came back.”</p>
<p>“And I— I can’t even picture her face anymore.”</p>
<p>He wept.</p>
<p>And his tears turned into glittering confetti on the wind.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Back in the TARDIS, the Doctor ran a scan of the entire moon.</p>
<p>Only two anomalies returned.</p>
<p>The first was the core — a mirror chamber sealed centuries ago by the founders of Miridell.</p>
<p>The second?</p>
<p>Anna’s heartbeat.</p>
<p>It pulsed at double time.</p>
<p>One for her.</p>
<p>One for a memory that shouldn’t exist.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="ch-03-chapter-three-the-house-of-many-faces">
  <h2>Chapter Three: The House of Many Faces</h2>
  <p>⸻</p>
<p>The Carnival didn’t sleep.</p>
<p>It pulsed.</p>
<p>Even in darkness, the glass walkways shimmered. The air was warm with pipe music and unseen chimes. But something beneath the harmony was starting to fray.</p>
<p>The Doctor stood before the House of Many Faces — a sprawling structure of interlocked mirror walls. The building had no clear entrance, only reflections that sometimes offered a way in… and sometimes watched back.</p>
<p>Anna clutched a folded map from one of the vendors. “This wasn’t here yesterday,” she said.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t,” the Doctor replied, studying the shifting reflections. “It’s quantum-temporal. Builds itself around memory. Or imagination. Whichever’s louder.”</p>
<p>“So it’s alive?”</p>
<p>“It’s… theatrical.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ava and Cal had taken a side path lined with paper lanterns that flickered like fireflies. The air was warmer here. More intimate.</p>
<p>They were searching for the laughter trail — energy signatures the TARDIS had marked as “deviant emotional harmonics.” Which was a long way of saying: laughter that doesn’t belong.</p>
<p>Cal stopped by a stall selling masks.</p>
<p>He picked up a harlequin one — gold and white, with half a smile.</p>
<p>“Used to love stuff like this as a kid,” he said. “Carnivals. Costumes. Pretending to be someone else.”</p>
<p>“And now?” Ava asked, watching him.</p>
<p>“Now I pretend not to be someone else,” he said, then gave a lopsided grin. “Progress, maybe.”</p>
<p>Ava smiled, a little longer than she needed to.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They reached the edge of the fairground.</p>
<p>The laughter trail ended at a stage.</p>
<p>An empty one.</p>
<p>Except for the flowers.</p>
<p>All the seats were filled with bouquets.</p>
<p>Every stem wrapped in mirrorfoil.</p>
<p>“An audience of ghosts,” Ava whispered.</p>
<p>And then a projector clicked on behind them.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>In the House of Many Faces, the Doctor and Anna stepped through what appeared to be a reflection of the carnival gate — only reversed, and upside down.</p>
<p>Inside, the rooms rearranged themselves like thoughts.</p>
<p>In one, a corridor of mirrors showed versions of Anna — tall, regal, grinning in a court of stars. In another, a single mirror showed the Doctor as an old man with a cracked pocket watch and no face.</p>
<p>“This place feeds on identity,” the Doctor muttered. “The more uncertain you are… the more it grows.”</p>
<p>“Why am I here, then?” Anna asked.</p>
<p>“Because you’re the only one who can find the real exit.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>He touched the edge of one mirror. His own hand didn’t reflect.</p>
<p>“Because you’re the only one whose reflection doesn’t know what to become.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Back at the projector, Ava and Cal watched in stunned silence.</p>
<p>The film flickered onto a white sheet.</p>
<p>It was footage of the carnival — but from above.</p>
<p>Thousands of people laughing. Dancing. Disappearing.</p>
<p>One by one.</p>
<p>The screen panned up.</p>
<p>To reveal a single, massive eye in the sky.</p>
<p>Watching.</p>
<p>Always watching.</p>
<p>The film melted mid-reel.</p>
<p>But the laughter didn’t stop.</p>
<p>Because it wasn’t from the film.</p>
<p>It was behind them.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="ch-04-chapter-four-curtain-rises">
  <h2>Chapter Four: Curtain Rises</h2>
  <p>⸻</p>
<p>The empty stage.</p>
<p>Ava and Cal turned.</p>
<p>Slowly.</p>
<p>Behind them stood six figures in faded costumes — clowns, dancers, masked ringmasters — their eyes glinting like old crystal, smiles stretched into just a little too much.</p>
<p>They did not speak.</p>
<p>They bowed.</p>
<p>And in perfect unison, raised hands with fingers like polished porcelain.</p>
<p>A voice echoed from the speakers above:</p>
<p>“You have been chosen.”</p>
<p>“For the performance.”</p>
<p>“Your audience awaits.”</p>
<p>The stage lights flared.</p>
<p>And then they were gone.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The House of Many Faces.</p>
<p>Anna wandered alone now.</p>
<p>The Doctor had disappeared — or perhaps she had.</p>
<p>She moved through a hall of tall, thin mirrors that made her legs stretch for metres, her face curl at odd angles.</p>
<p>Each mirror whispered her name.</p>
<p>Not just “Anna.”</p>
<p>But other versions:</p>
<p>“Ananke.”</p>
<p>“Spectra.”</p>
<p>“The Girl Who Didn’t Turn Away.”</p>
<p>And one… just said “Host.”</p>
<p>She paused.</p>
<p>“What does that mean?”</p>
<p>But the mirror only smiled.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>In another corridor, the Doctor stepped through a curtain of shimmering thread into what looked like a simple study. A fireplace flickered. A chessboard sat mid-game. Bookshelves climbed the walls in an impossible spiral.</p>
<p>And in the armchair —</p>
<p>— a version of himself.</p>
<p>Older.</p>
<p>No beard.</p>
<p>Eyes that burned with a colder fire.</p>
<p>“Oh no,” the Doctor muttered. “Not him.”</p>
<p>The other Doctor looked up.</p>
<p>And grinned without humour.</p>
<p>“Did you really think the Carnival didn’t have stand-ins?”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Back on the stage, Cal blinked.</p>
<p>He and Ava were seated now — opposite each other, spotlights shining down.</p>
<p>A painted audience surrounded them. Static. Glimmering.</p>
<p>Waiting.</p>
<p>A placard hovered above: “Tell your Truth. Make them Laugh.”</p>
<p>A bell chimed.</p>
<p>Ava stood slowly. Her voice trembled slightly.</p>
<p>“I was supposed to be married.”</p>
<p>The audience leaned in.</p>
<p>“He was kind. Brilliant. And then one day, he… he changed. Not in a big way. Just little things.”</p>
<p>“I kept laughing. Pretending. Because it was easier.”</p>
<p>She looked down.</p>
<p>Then looked up again, eyes hard now.</p>
<p>“But laughing didn’t stop the lies. It just covered them in velvet.”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Then, applause.</p>
<p>Mechanical. Relentless.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Cal’s turn.</p>
<p>He stood, hands clenched.</p>
<p>“I ran from everything. War. Family. Choices.”</p>
<p>“I pretended I was helping people so I wouldn’t have to stay anywhere long enough to be needed.”</p>
<p>He hesitated.</p>
<p>Then looked at Ava.</p>
<p>“But I stayed. For Berlin. For you.”</p>
<p>“That was real.”</p>
<p>More silence.</p>
<p>This time, the applause felt… warmer.</p>
<p>Almost real.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The lights dimmed.</p>
<p>A door opened at the back of the stage.</p>
<p>A way out?</p>
<p>A way deeper in?</p>
<p>They didn’t hesitate.</p>
<p>They took it together.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>In the study, the older Doctor circled the younger one.</p>
<p>“You perform now,” he sneered. “You let them in. That girl — Anna — she’s already connected to the Audience.”</p>
<p>“You’ve let it feed.”</p>
<p>“You’ve let it watch.”</p>
<p>The Doctor didn’t reply.</p>
<p>He simply stepped forward, placed a hand on the chessboard…</p>
<p>…and turned it upside down.</p>
<p>The entire study dissolved into a kaleidoscope of mirrors.</p>
<p>And he fell through.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Anna stood before a single, circular mirror.</p>
<p>In it: a throne.</p>
<p>On it: the Jester — Carnavas — now wearing a crown of broken laughter.</p>
<p>“The Carnival never ends,” he whispered.</p>
<p>“And the Audience is hungry.”</p>
<p>“But if you host it… if you channel it… no one else has to be forgotten.”</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>“I’m not a conduit.”</p>
<p>“I’m a person.”</p>
<p>The mirror cracked.</p>
<p>And for the first time, Carnavas looked afraid.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="ch-05-chapter-five-refraction">
  <h2>Chapter Five: Refraction</h2>
  <p>⸻</p>
<p>The doors to the House of Many Faces burst open with a thunderclap of wind and glitter.</p>
<p>The Doctor stumbled through, his coat torn at one sleeve, hair tousled, expression thunderous.</p>
<p>Behind him, the hall twisted, convulsed, and then sealed itself shut as if it had never been there at all.</p>
<p>Waiting for him in the centre square were Ava, Cal, and Anna — all pale, all silent.</p>
<p>The Doctor looked at them each in turn.</p>
<p>Then gently, seriously:</p>
<p>“Did any of you agree to anything?”</p>
<p>Anna blinked. “To what?”</p>
<p>“Anything. A question. A riddle. A dance. A contract. A joke.”</p>
<p>“The Carnival doesn’t ask with words. It offers. It invites. And if you play… you belong.”</p>
<p>“Even if you don’t know it yet.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They returned to the TARDIS in a rush of unease.</p>
<p>But as soon as the Doctor unlocked the doors, he stopped dead.</p>
<p>The central console room had changed.</p>
<p>Slightly.</p>
<p>Subtly.</p>
<p>Mirrored surfaces shimmered faintly across the walls. Not installed — grown. Polished nodes of reflection, like bubbles formed in the coral structure of the ship itself.</p>
<p>Anna stepped forward first.</p>
<p>“No,” she whispered. “No, this is… inside me.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor activated a field scan.</p>
<p>The results made no sense.</p>
<p>The Carnival had followed them.</p>
<p>Or more accurately — had stuck to them.</p>
<p>Trace psychic particles.</p>
<p>Quantum hooks.</p>
<p>Ava and Cal bore faint traces of memory alteration, but Anna…</p>
<p>“You’re refracting,” the Doctor said softly.</p>
<p>“What does that mean?” Anna asked.</p>
<p>He hesitated.</p>
<p>Then knelt before her.</p>
<p>“It means… you’re starting to split.”</p>
<p>“Whatever Carnavas did — whatever you did in that mirror chamber — it’s stretching you between two selves.”</p>
<p>“One who remembers being Ananke…”</p>
<p>“And one who was never supposed to exist at all.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Later, in the TARDIS kitchen — a space designed to resemble a London flat with an unreasonable number of kettles — Cal handed Ava a cup of steaming herbal tea.</p>
<p>She accepted it with a faint smile.</p>
<p>“That stage… what we said… was that…”</p>
<p>“Real?” Cal asked.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>He took a breath.</p>
<p>“Yes. All of it.”</p>
<p>“And if we get out of this alive, maybe we talk about what’s next.”</p>
<p>Ava didn’t speak right away.</p>
<p>But she didn’t look away either.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Doctor stood alone in the corridor outside Anna’s room.</p>
<p>His reflection didn’t match him.</p>
<p>The man in the mirror had no eyes.</p>
<p>Just spinning glass where his soul should be.</p>
<p>And he was smiling.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="ch-06-chapter-six-the-curtain-inside">
  <h2>Chapter Six: The Curtain Inside</h2>
  <p>⸻</p>
<p>The TARDIS.</p>
<p>She hummed, but off-key.</p>
<p>Lights flickered in odd patterns. Doors no longer opened into rooms they were supposed to. Sometimes, the same corridor turned left… twice in a row.</p>
<p>“It’s inside her now,” the Doctor said, pacing furiously around the console.</p>
<p>“The Carnival’s psyche. The infection isn’t just following us — it’s inhabiting us. And her.”</p>
<p>“She’s not infected,” Ava replied, arms folded.</p>
<p>“She’s… entertained.”</p>
<p>The Doctor flinched.</p>
<p>“Yes. That’s worse.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Anna’s room.</p>
<p>She sat cross-legged on the floor, surrounded by dozens of floating reflections.</p>
<p>Each one showed her in different lights, different ages.</p>
<p>In one, she was in a school uniform, smiling with a friend she didn’t remember.</p>
<p>In another, she was wearing ceremonial robes on a world of spiral suns.</p>
<p>And in one — the one closest to her — she wasn’t smiling at all.</p>
<p>She was staring directly back, head tilted, eyes calm.</p>
<p>“You can’t keep both,” the other Anna said softly.</p>
<p>“One of us has to go.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Cal.</p>
<p>He opened a door expecting the console room.</p>
<p>He got a battlefield.</p>
<p>The smell hit him first — fire, metal, ash.</p>
<p>Bodies were scattered in the dust, faceless and glassy-eyed.</p>
<p>He stepped through instinctively… and heard his name.</p>
<p>“Lieutenant Calderon!” a voice barked.</p>
<p>He turned.</p>
<p>A man stood in uniform, burnt and cracked but unmistakably familiar.</p>
<p>“You left us,” the soldier hissed. “We held the line. You ran.”</p>
<p>“You made a life telling people you were a hero.”</p>
<p>“But I died in that trench, and you shined boots on starships.”</p>
<p>“Say it.”</p>
<p>Cal’s fists shook.</p>
<p>His voice broke.</p>
<p>“I ran.”</p>
<p>The soldier vanished.</p>
<p>And the door reopened.</p>
<p>This time, it led where it should.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Ava.</p>
<p>She walked into a forest.</p>
<p>No trees — just glass sculptures of trees.</p>
<p>Each one hummed softly with a different voice.</p>
<p>They all said her name.</p>
<p>Over and over.</p>
<p>Until she covered her ears.</p>
<p>A single figure stood in the clearing: her old fiancée.</p>
<p>“I never hurt you,” he said gently.</p>
<p>“Not with fists. Not with words.”</p>
<p>“But you left me like I had.”</p>
<p>She stepped back.</p>
<p>“Because you never saw me.”</p>
<p>“Only the version you liked.”</p>
<p>She blinked.</p>
<p>The forest shattered around her.</p>
<p>She was in the corridor again.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor.</p>
<p>The mirror in the TARDIS library refused to show anything.</p>
<p>He stood in front of it.</p>
<p>Waited.</p>
<p>And finally, it cracked.</p>
<p>The figure within was tall, still.</p>
<p>Eyes hidden behind dark lenses.</p>
<p>Wearing a coat of spun obsidian.</p>
<p>The Doctor knew him instantly.</p>
<p>“The Valeyard,” he whispered.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t be here.”</p>
<p>“Neither should the Carnival,” the shadow replied.</p>
<p>“But you brought it.”</p>
<p>“Every time you left someone behind.”</p>
<p>“Every time you lied to save a planet and ruined a life.”</p>
<p>The Doctor reached forward.</p>
<p>Touched the glass.</p>
<p>“I remember every one.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I win.”</p>
<p>The reflection smiled.</p>
<p>“We’ll see.”</p>
<p>And vanished.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Console Room. Later.</p>
<p>They all gathered again.</p>
<p>Bruised. Shaken. Changed.</p>
<p>Anna sat a little straighter.</p>
<p>Ava and Cal didn’t stand so far apart.</p>
<p>And the Doctor…</p>
<p>He stared at the time rotor.</p>
<p>“We have to go back,” he said finally.</p>
<p>“Back to the Carnival.”</p>
<p>“Back to the Core.”</p>
<p>“Because this isn’t about joy. Or illusion.”</p>
<p>“It’s about something deeper.”</p>
<p>“Something hungry.”</p>
<p>He looked at them each in turn.</p>
<p>“And it knows all our names now.”</p>

  <h2>Chapter Seven: The Deal</h2>
  <p>⸻</p>
<p>Return to Miridell.</p>
<p>The TARDIS landed with less ceremony this time.</p>
<p>No musical chime.</p>
<p>No sparkle.</p>
<p>Just a soft thud, like a coffin being shut.</p>
<p>Outside, the Carnival of Glass had changed.</p>
<p>No longer a dazzling celebration — now it stood still. Silent. Tent cloths sagged, colours bled pale. Crystal stilts cracked and leaned like dying trees.</p>
<p>No one laughed.</p>
<p>No one danced.</p>
<p>And every mirror — every single one — showed only one thing:</p>
<p>Anna.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Ava stepped out first.</p>
<p>She held her sonic close — a long, dark bronze model the Doctor had made for her months ago when they escaped a collapsing time pocket in 13th-century Kyoto.</p>
<p>It had twin buttons and an extendable scanning rod. Cal called it the “stingray,” for the way it flared when activated.</p>
<p>She scanned the empty streets.</p>
<p>No life signs.</p>
<p>No heat.</p>
<p>But massive chronotemporal drag — as if time had been arrested mid-step.</p>
<p>“They’re waiting,” the Doctor said quietly.</p>
<p>“The Carnival knows we came back. And now it wants payment.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>A figure waited in the central plaza.</p>
<p>Tall.</p>
<p>Thin.</p>
<p>Wearing a theatre mask of bleached bone.</p>
<p>He bowed as they approached.</p>
<p>“You’ve crossed the fourth curtain,” he said. “You cannot leave freely again.”</p>
<p>“A performance has been watched.”</p>
<p>“A debt must be paid.”</p>
<p>“One must stay. One must perform.”</p>
<p>Cal frowned. “Perform what?”</p>
<p>The figure didn’t blink.</p>
<p>“The self. Again. And again. Until the Audience is full.”</p>
<p>“If no one chooses… then all of you belong.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>The Doctor stepped forward.</p>
<p>“No deal. This was never a contract. We were misled. Manipulated.”</p>
<p>“Worse than that, you turned joy into currency.”</p>
<p>“You fed on souls in exchange for applause.”</p>
<p>The figure tilted its head.</p>
<p>“And you—Doctor—have fed on admiration, legend, and myth.”</p>
<p>“You’ve performed for centuries.”</p>
<p>“Your story is delicious.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Anna trembled.</p>
<p>Because somewhere, just beyond her thoughts, a low murmuring had begun.</p>
<p>Not words.</p>
<p>Applause.</p>
<p>Soft, rhythmic, endless.</p>
<p>“Doctor,” she whispered. “I hear them.”</p>
<p>“The Audience.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Later, in the TARDIS, the team argued.</p>
<p>Ava wanted to scan for weak points in the Carnival’s structure.</p>
<p>Cal wanted to sneak into the mirrored core and shatter the system from within.</p>
<p>The Doctor… was uncharacteristically quiet.</p>
<p>Anna stood by the doors, staring at her reflection in the hexagonal window.</p>
<p>It didn’t move when she did.</p>
<p>It smiled first.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>That night, the Carnival lit up again.</p>
<p>Tents re-erected themselves.</p>
<p>The music resumed — but wrong, off-key, dragged.</p>
<p>The Doctor set the TARDIS to lockdown and paced the console room, adjusting levers and murmuring calculations.</p>
<p>Ava watched him from the upper deck.</p>
<p>Cal joined her, arms folded, quiet for once.</p>
<p>“He’s scared,” Cal said.</p>
<p>“He’s always scared,” Ava replied. “He just doesn’t always show it.”</p>
<p>They stood in silence a moment longer.</p>
<p>Then Ava took his hand.</p>
<p>Cal didn’t let go.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Anna didn’t sleep.</p>
<p>She sat at the end of her bed, mirror in her lap.</p>
<p>And from within the glass, Carnavas whispered:</p>
<p>“You were always the star.”</p>
<p>“You just forgot the stage.”</p>

<section class="chapter" id="ch-08-chapter-eight-the-audience-must-be-fed">
  <h2>Chapter Eight: The Audience Must Be Fed</h2>
  <p>⸻</p>
<p>The TARDIS doors were wide open.</p>
<p>No breach alarm. No sonic trip. No warning.</p>
<p>Just air drifting in from the Carnival — stale, sweet, too warm.</p>
<p>Anna was gone.</p>
<p>Her bed neatly made.</p>
<p>Her sonic badge left on the side table like a discarded ticket.</p>
<p>The Doctor stared at the doors for a long time, silent.</p>
<p>Ava moved to speak.</p>
<p>He raised one finger without looking.</p>
<p>“No. No speeches. Not yet.”</p>
<p>Cal checked the interior logs. “She walked out. Alone. Two hours ago.”</p>
<p>“No pressure breach?”</p>
<p>“None.”</p>
<p>“Then she wanted to be taken.”</p>
<p>“No,” Ava said, softly. “She wanted to protect us.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Inside the TARDIS, things were dying.</p>
<p>Whole corridors — gone.</p>
<p>Rooms sealed with laughter-loop echoes. The library flickered with translucent pages. The wardrobe room now showed only costumes from Carnival acts, never anything the Doctor had actually owned.</p>
<p>Even the console was dimmer.</p>
<p>The coral roots on the ceiling had gone dull, calcified.</p>
<p>The Doctor closed his eyes and leaned his forehead against the monitor.</p>
<p>“You’re fighting it, old girl. I know.”</p>
<p>“But we’ve got to go deeper.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>He led them out again, not in a rush but with dreadful intent.</p>
<p>No detours. No investigation.</p>
<p>Straight through the Carnival to the mirror gate.</p>
<p>At the centre of Miridell.</p>
<p>A door that wasn’t there before.</p>
<p>A gate of black glass taller than a cathedral, rippling with impossible faces — the collected reflections of everyone the Carnival had ever devoured.</p>
<p>Ava paused.</p>
<p>“Are we coming back from this?”</p>
<p>The Doctor didn’t answer.</p>
<p>Instead, he lifted a small device from his coat: a thin sliver of compressed light, a refractor key.</p>
<p>“Anna gave me this,” he said. “Or a version of her did. She said it would open the curtain.”</p>
<p>“She said… the Audience has never been seen.”</p>
<p>“And that’s why it’s still hungry.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They stepped through the mirror gate.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Inside the Core.</p>
<p>Glass stretched in every direction — a fractal cathedral, curving upward and downward at once.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t empty.</p>
<p>Dozens of versions of people flickered in and out of existence — duplicates of Ava, Cal, even the Doctor — each acting out moments. Laughing. Crying. Performing.</p>
<p>And above it all: a great stage.</p>
<p>No walls.</p>
<p>No props.</p>
<p>Just one chair at its centre, facing the void.</p>
<p>The Doctor turned slowly.</p>
<p>And saw them.</p>
<p>Not a creature.</p>
<p>Not even a being.</p>
<p>But a presence.</p>
<p>A suspended ripple of light and time, shaped like an audience — a million overlapping faces, eyeless and grinning, hands raised in infinite applause.</p>
<p>They didn’t speak.</p>
<p>But he heard it.</p>
<p>“We watched the birth of fire.”</p>
<p>“We watched the fall of stars.”</p>
<p>“We watched you, Doctor.”</p>
<p>“You gave us endless episodes.”</p>
<p>“But now you’ve grown boring.”</p>
<p>“We want a new star.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stepped forward, defiant.</p>
<p>“She’s a child.”</p>
<p>“She’s human.”</p>
<p>“You don’t get to feed on her.”</p>
<p>The Audience tilted.</p>
<p>Just slightly.</p>
<p>“We do not feed.”</p>
<p>“We witness.”</p>
<p>“We elevate.”</p>
<p>“And when you are not enough… we find one who is.”</p>
<p>And suddenly, there she was.</p>
<p>Anna.</p>
<p>Dressed in silver-white robes of Carnival silk, a mirrored mask in one hand, her expression blank.</p>
<p>But her eyes…</p>
<p>Still hers.</p>
<p>Still frightened.</p>
<p>Still fighting.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Ava started forward — but Cal stopped her.</p>
<p>“She’s not in control,” he said.</p>
<p>“If we break the ritual too soon, we lose her.”</p>
<p>“If we wait too long—”</p>
<p>“We lose everything,” the Doctor finished.</p>
<p>He turned.</p>
<p>Faced the stage.</p>
<p>Faced the Audience.</p>
<p>“Then let’s give them a performance they’ll never forget.”</p>

</section>
<section class="chapter" id="ch-09-chapter-nine-the-infinite-act">
  <h2>Chapter Nine: The Infinite Act</h2>
  <p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor stood beneath the glittering throne, looking up at Anna.</p>
<p>She hovered now — not literally, but emotionally — suspended between presence and performance. The mask dangled from her fingertips, a sliver away from her face.</p>
<p>The Audience pulsed in hunger, or anticipation. It was hard to tell which. A thousand hands clapped slowly in overlapping rhythms, like thunder caught in echo.</p>
<p>He bowed.</p>
<p>A single, low bend of the waist.</p>
<p>“Ladies and gentlemen. Entities and ephemera. Consciousnesses across concept and continuum…”</p>
<p>“Tonight, I present for your… dwindling attention…”</p>
<p>“A story.”</p>
<p>The clapping stopped.</p>
<p>The Audience leaned closer.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Plan had been simple in theory.</p>
<p>Run a recursive, endlessly looping story structure — like trapping a parasite in its own digestive tract.</p>
<p>Only the most experienced time minds could execute it.</p>
<p>And only one person was foolish enough to try.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“Once upon a time,” the Doctor began, pacing in a wide circle, “there was a traveller who told a story.”</p>
<p>“The story began with him telling a story.”</p>
<p>“That story was also about a man telling a story.”</p>
<p>“And inside that story…”</p>
<p>“He told a story about a traveller who told a story…”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The mirrors cracked.</p>
<p>The Audience rippled.</p>
<p>Some of the hands fell limp.</p>
<p>Others began to twitch.</p>
<p>One face blinked out entirely.</p>
<p>Another rewound into itself.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ava and Cal slipped behind the mirrored curtain lining the core’s perimeter, looking for Anna’s tether — the heart-thread that bound her performance to the stage.</p>
<p>Time was erratic inside the fold.</p>
<p>Cal’s wrist display spun endlessly.</p>
<p>Ava’s sonic only worked when she wasn’t looking at it.</p>
<p>But together they moved silently, closer, closer—</p>
<p>And found it.</p>
<p>A single filament of light reaching from Anna’s spine to the centre of the mirror throne.</p>
<p>It pulsed with the rhythm of applause.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Back on the stage, the Doctor spun in wide theatrical arcs.</p>
<p>“And in that final story… the story changed.”</p>
<p>“It became a farce. A parody.”</p>
<p>“It lost coherence. It became boring.”</p>
<p>“Predictable.”</p>
<p>“Dull.”</p>
<p>He whispered the last word like a curse.</p>
<p>And waited.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Audience began to groan.</p>
<p>A low tremor.</p>
<p>Faces folded.</p>
<p>Voices splintered into static.</p>
<p>A chorus of displeasure — ancient and annoyed.</p>
<p>The light in the Carnival Core dimmed.</p>
<p>“Stop,” Anna whispered.</p>
<p>The Doctor turned.</p>
<p>She looked down at him — eyes full of sudden fear.</p>
<p>“They’re not leaving, Doctor.”</p>
<p>“They’re getting ready to replace you.”</p>
<p>“With me.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Ava struck the tether with her sonic.</p>
<p>The pulse shattered like glass wind.</p>
<p>Anna fell forward—</p>
<p>And the Doctor caught her mid-collapse.</p>
<p>The mirrors cracked.</p>
<p>The Audience screamed.</p>
<p>Not from rage.</p>
<p>From withdrawal.</p>
<p>The theatre structure began to shake, ripple, disintegrate like burned film.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>“RUN!” the Doctor shouted.</p>
<p>The four of them bolted across the fractal floor.</p>
<p>The Doctor tossed a black disc — a “boring bomb,” he called it — over his shoulder. It exploded in a puff of paperwork, tax returns, and elevator music.</p>
<p>The Audience fled.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Moments later, they stumbled into the TARDIS, breathless, bleeding light.</p>
<p>Doors slammed shut.</p>
<p>The central column surged to life.</p>
<p>The Carnival—</p>
<p>Gone.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They didn’t speak right away.</p>
<p>Cal sat on the steps, breathing hard.</p>
<p>Ava collapsed against the railing, eyes damp.</p>
<p>Anna stood in the console’s reflection… watching her face slowly stop flickering.</p>
<p>The Doctor set coordinates silently.</p>
<p>His face unreadable.</p>
<p>But when the TARDIS finally landed—</p>
<p>He turned to them.</p>
<p>“One chapter left.”</p>
<p>“Then it’s curtain call.”</p>
  <a class="back" href="#top">↑ Back to contents</a>
</section>
<section class="chapter" id="ch-10-chapter-ten-curtain-call">
  <h2>Chapter Ten: Curtain Call</h2>
  <p>⸻</p>
<p>The coordinates were unmarked.</p>
<p>No planet. No date. No history.</p>
<p>Just a patch of void between stars, where the timelines hummed in nervous silence.</p>
<p>The TARDIS materialised with a whisper instead of a roar.</p>
<p>Outside was… nothing.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t empty.</p>
<p>“Residual psychic heat,” the Doctor murmured, scanning with his screwdriver. “The Carnival left a footprint.”</p>
<p>“Is it coming back?” Ava asked.</p>
<p>“Not exactly,” he said. “It left a… final act. A kind of backup. One last question to resolve.”</p>
<p>“What question?” Anna asked.</p>
<p>The Doctor looked at her.</p>
<p>Soft. Sad. Honest.</p>
<p>“You.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The platform hung in the void like an abandoned stage.</p>
<p>Six floating mirrors circled it — cracked, but still pulsing faintly.</p>
<p>At the centre: a glowing version of Anna.</p>
<p>Not a copy. Not a clone.</p>
<p>A consequence.</p>
<p>This version wore the Carnival’s crown. Her eyes were filled with mirrored galaxies. Her voice, when she spoke, echoed like the applause they’d heard for days.</p>
<p>“You left me,” she said.</p>
<p>Anna stepped forward, breathing slowly.</p>
<p>“You weren’t me.”</p>
<p>“I was the version of you who said yes. Who let them in. Who stayed. Who belonged.”</p>
<p>“And what happens now?” Anna asked.</p>
<p>The mirrored self tilted her head.</p>
<p>“You decide.”</p>
<p>“We can merge. I can vanish. Or I can… take over.”</p>
<p>“There’s still an audience somewhere. Waiting.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>The Doctor placed a gentle hand on Anna’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“This isn’t a test. There’s no correct answer. Only… who you want to be.”</p>
<p>She stepped forward alone.</p>
<p>She looked her other self in the eyes.</p>
<p>And whispered:</p>
<p>“You’re not me.”</p>
<p>“You’re a part of me.”</p>
<p>“But I get to choose who I am.”</p>
<p>She reached out.</p>
<p>Touched the mirror-self’s hand.</p>
<p>And gently pulled it inward — into herself.</p>
<p>The crown fell.</p>
<p>Shattered.</p>
<p>The mirrors dissolved.</p>
<p>And the platform cracked apart.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>They tumbled into the TARDIS — which caught them like an old friend.</p>
<p>Anna collapsed in the console room, blinking tears, her face her own again.</p>
<p>“It’s over,” Ava said, kneeling beside her.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Cal added. “I think the Carnival’s really done.”</p>
<p>Anna looked up at them.</p>
<p>“They still whisper,” she said softly. “But I think they’re leaving.”</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Later, the Doctor stood at the console alone.</p>
<p>He held a mask in his hands — the one Carnavas had worn.</p>
<p>It had appeared in his coat pocket after they left the void.</p>
<p>He turned it over once.</p>
<p>Twice.</p>
<p>And then set it down on the console.</p>
<p>“No more curtain calls,” he said.</p>
<p>“No more performances.”</p>
<p>He looked up, saw Ava and Cal talking near the stairs — close now, quieter, no need for drama.</p>
<p>He saw Anna in the reading room, sketching in a journal.</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>Then the TARDIS chimed.</p>
<p>A new signal.</p>
<p>Strange, distant, funny.</p>
<p>The Doctor looked at it.</p>
<p>Then looked toward the others.</p>
<p>“Anyone fancy a trip to a planet that thinks it’s a hat?”</p>
<p>Anna blinked. “What?”</p>
<p>“Or maybe it’s a hat that thinks it’s a planet. Honestly, I’m not sure. But it’s insisting we help.”</p>
<p>Cal laughed. “I’m in.”</p>
<p>Ava smiled. “Let’s go.”</p>
<p>The Doctor pulled the lever.</p>
<p>The engines groaned. The lights brightened.</p>
<p>And with one final whoosh—</p>
<p>They were gone.</p>
<p>Onward.</p>
