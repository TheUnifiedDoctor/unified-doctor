# Part I: The Origin of Doctor Who and the Many Faces of the Doctor

---

## A New Kind of Hero (1963)

On **23 November 1963**, the BBC broadcast the first episode of *Doctor Who*. It was created in an era of post-war optimism mixed with anxiety. Television was still young, science was booming, and the BBC wanted a program that could educate as well as entertain. The idea: a time-travel show that would take children to historical periods one week and distant galaxies the next.

The central character was deliberately unusual: not a soldier, not a superhero, not even a conventional father figure. He was called simply **“the Doctor”**. His ship, the **TARDIS**, could travel anywhere in time and space, but it had a broken “chameleon circuit,” leaving it disguised as a 1960s London police telephone box.

At first, the Doctor was played by **William Hartnell**. He was mysterious, elderly, a bit gruff. Importantly, no one at the BBC planned for the role to last forever. But when Hartnell’s health declined after three years, producers invented a bold narrative solution: the Doctor would **change his face and personality while remaining the same character**.

That idea — **regeneration** — allowed the series to endure for six decades, reinventing itself every few years with new actors, new styles, and new stories.

## The First Doctor (1963–1966)

**Actor:** William Hartnell

* **Personality & Style:** Stern, irascible, paternal. He began as manipulative and secretive, softening into a grandfatherly figure who cared deeply for his companions. Costume: Edwardian frock coat, checked trousers, cane.
* **Notable Adventures:**

  * *An Unearthly Child* (1963) — the very first story, introducing the Doctor, his granddaughter Susan, and human schoolteachers Ian and Barbara.
  * *The Daleks* (1963–64) — introduced the Doctor’s most famous enemies.
  * *The Time Meddler* (1965) — the first story with another Time Lord.
* **Reason for Regeneration:** Hartnell’s declining health made production difficult. In-story, the Doctor collapsed from exhaustion after battling the Cybermen in *The Tenth Planet* (1966). His body “renewed” itself, leading into the Second Doctor.

## Closing Note on Regeneration

From stern grandfather to cosmic clown, from romantic hero to battle-scarred survivor, from exuberant optimist to ancient strategist — the Doctor has been many things. Each incarnation brings change, yet remains part of the same story.

The concept of **regeneration** is more than a plot device. It embodies the show’s philosophy: people can change, adapt, and reinvent themselves while still remaining who they are.

And it is this very concept — many lives converging — that sets the stage for **The Unified Doctor**, who is not one of these faces, but *all of them at once*.
