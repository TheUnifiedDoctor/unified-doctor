# Part VII: Who the Unified Doctor Is (Master Profile)

*(A concise, practical character dossier to anchor the voice, manner, and visual continuity across the books.)*

## Physical

* **Appearance:** Early-middle aged, **light brown hair**, **brown eyes**, about **5′11″**.
* **Presence:** Quietly kinetic. He seems still until he moves; then you notice how precisely he occupies space (a hand on a bannister, fingertips reading the grain of a door).

## Dress

* **Day-to-day:** **Rust-brown tweed blazer** with brown leather elbow patches (three-button, patch pockets) over a **plain white T-shirt**; **blue jeans** or **black waxed denim**; well-broken-in boots.
* **Occasional:** Dark coat when weather or mood turns; gloves for delicate work; no costume-play—he dresses like someone who intends to carry boxes *and* ideas.

## Tools & Kit

* **No sonic screwdriver.** On purpose.
* **Analog field kit:** Skeleton keys, loop magnifier, micro-compass, wax chalk, a slim roll of insulated wire, fountain pen and notebook (thick paper; he sketches rooms as he talks).
* **Time sense:** A battered **pocket watch** that keeps bad time but good truth; it’s a grounding ritual as much as a device.
* **MINO:** A palm-sized brass-and-gold **Memory Inference & Navigation Organism**—an owl who archives, maps, and challenges him when he’s about to lie to himself.
* **The TARDIS:** His great companion—alive, moody, and wiser than he is. She opens where needed, not always where asked.

## Manner & Voice

* **Speech:** Warm cadence, lightly sardonic when defusing fear; never cruel. He prefers “tell me about it” to “explain yourself.”
* **Humor:** Dry, humane. He uses it to give others breathing room, not to score points.
* **Listening:** He does it with his whole posture. People notice and tell him more than they meant to.

## Habits & Sensibilities

* **Tea:** Black, often floral (he’ll accept ordinary strong brew without comment).
* **Music:** Classical for thinking; unexpected folk for courage.
* **Work style:** Tidies a desk before attempting impossible things; writes questions in the margins, not answers.
* **Boundaries:** He will not threaten a life to speed a solution. If that slows him, so be it.

## Moral Profile (“how he decides”)

* **Default stance:** *Protect the vulnerable; confront the bully; hold the bill.*
* **Reflex:** Look for the thing no one is measuring—feelings, forgotten workers, the door that “isn’t on the plan.”
* **Pressure response:** Under duress he grows very calm and very simple. The echo of older tempers is there, but he chooses clarity over heat.

## Vulnerabilities

* **Identity strain:** Certain places (archives, galleries of possibilities) can pull too many echoes forward at once. He steps back, grounds, or asks an ally to take point.
* **Loneliness:** Wholeness didn’t cure it. It made it more articulate. He manages it by making sure someone else gets to be brave in every story.

## Signature Moves

* **The better question:** Changes the entire room with one line.
* **The third door:** Finds or *makes* it when offered a cruel binary.
* **Mercy as leverage:** Offers it early and keeps offering; tyrants don’t know what to do with that.
* **Leave-behind:** A note, a repaired hinge, a number to call—something small that says: *your life matters after I go.*

## Visual Motifs

* **Hands:** Scar on the knuckle, ink on the finger. He *touches* worlds—rails, stone, bark—as if reading them.
* **Light:** Rooms feel warmer by the time he leaves; even cold ones feel *truer*.

### A final word to new readers

You don’t need to memorize anything above to enjoy the books. Think of this as the smell of the room before the story starts. When the door opens, you’ll recognize him: the person who makes you feel safer *and* braver, often at the same time. The one who asks a better question and then waits—really waits—for your answer.

That’s the Unified Doctor. That’s why we wrote him this way.
