# Part V: Beyond Television ‚Äî The Expanded Worlds of Doctor Who

---

## The Transmedia Nature of the Doctor

Most television programs begin and end with their broadcasts. *Doctor Who* is different. Since its birth in 1963, it has spilled outward into **books, audio plays, comics, stage shows, films, and spin-offs**.

This expansion was not just merchandising. It was survival. Whenever television faltered ‚Äî in the 1980s, in the long ‚ÄúWilderness Years,‚Äù even between modern series ‚Äî the Doctor lived on in other media.

For new readers of *The Unified Doctor Adventures*, this is vital context: the Doctor you meet in these novels belongs to a tradition of *multiplicity*. He has always existed in many formats at once.

## 1. The Books

### Target Novelisations (1970s‚Äì1990s)

For decades, home video was rare. If you wanted to revisit an old adventure, you couldn‚Äôt. The BBC solved this by commissioning **Target Books** to publish prose novelisations of televised episodes.

* Writers often expanded the scripts, adding depth and new scenes.
* Many children discovered the Doctor through these slim paperbacks, developing literacy and imagination in equal measure.
* Even today, writers who grew up with Target books credit them for inspiring their careers.

### The New Adventures & Missing Adventures (1990s)

When the TV show ended in 1989, novels became the primary vehicle for new stories.

* **Virgin New Adventures (NAs):** Continued the Seventh Doctor‚Äôs adventures, darker and more adult.
* **Virgin Missing Adventures (MAs):** Explored earlier Doctors with ‚Äúlost‚Äù stories.
* Notable characters included **Bernice Summerfield**, an archaeologist companion who became so popular she earned her own spin-off series.

These books treated the Doctor as a serious literary character, paving the way for The Unified Doctor‚Äôs tone.

### BBC Books (late 1990s onward)

After Virgin lost the license, BBC Books created two strands:

* **Past Doctor Adventures (PDAs):** Traditional stories set in the TV continuity.
* **Eighth Doctor Adventures (EDAs):** Gave Paul McGann‚Äôs Doctor a sustained literary era, with long-running arcs.

Later, the **New Series Adventures (NSAs)** accompanied the 2005 revival, written for children and young adults but enjoyed widely.

## 2. The Audio Dramas

### Big Finish Productions (1999 onward)

Big Finish changed everything.

* They secured the rights to produce official *Doctor Who* audio dramas.
* Classic Doctors (Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, Paul McGann) reprised their roles.
* Former companions returned, often given richer development than they‚Äôd had on TV.
* Entirely new companions ‚Äî like Evelyn Smythe, Hex, and Charlotte Pollard ‚Äî became beloved.

Big Finish offered **cinematic audio storytelling**: sophisticated plots, mature themes, experimental formats.

Highlights include:

* *Spare Parts* (2002) ‚Äî the tragic origin of the Cybermen.
* *The Chimes of Midnight* ‚Äî a time-twisting haunted house story.
* *Dark Eyes* and *Doom Coalition* ‚Äî long-form sagas for the Eighth Doctor.

Today, Big Finish produces hundreds of hours of Doctor Who content, far more than TV ever could.

## 3. Comics

### Doctor Who Magazine (DWM)

Since 1979, *Doctor Who Magazine* has run continuous comic strips, often featuring the current Doctor. Writers like **Alan Moore** cut their teeth here, and the comics often explored concepts too wild for TV budgets.

### Other Publishers

* Marvel UK produced *Doctor Who Weekly* in the 1980s.
* IDW and Titan Comics in later years brought the Doctor to global audiences.

The comics often paired the Doctor with unique companions and leaned into science-fantasy surrealism.

## 4. Spin-Off Television

The modern revival led to new shows, expanding the Whoniverse:

* **Torchwood (2006‚Äì2011):** An adult-oriented series led by Captain Jack Harkness, darker and more violent than Doctor Who.
* **The Sarah Jane Adventures (2007‚Äì2011):** A family-friendly spin-off featuring beloved companion Sarah Jane Smith, introducing younger viewers to alien mysteries.
* **Class (2016):** A short-lived teen drama set in a school connected to the Doctor.

Each explored corners of the universe beyond the Doctor, proving the world was fertile ground for many stories.

## 5. Stage, Radio, and More

The Doctor has appeared in stage plays, web animations, and BBC radio dramas. Even when budgets were minimal, creativity flourished. The Doctor‚Äôs format ‚Äî a ship that can land anywhere, a character who can be anyone ‚Äî made him adaptable to any medium.

---

## Why This Matters

For new readers, the key takeaway is this:

üëâ *Doctor Who* is not just a TV show. It is a **mythology told across media**.

* Some fans discovered the Doctor in Target novelisations.
* Others met him in audio dramas.
* Others in comics or spin-offs.

The Unified Doctor Adventures belong to this tradition. They are not meant to replace television Doctor Who, but to stand alongside it ‚Äî another doorway into the same legend.

## Conclusion of Part V

The Doctor thrives because he refuses to be confined. When one medium falters, another sustains him.

This is why readers unfamiliar with *Doctor Who* can step into *The Unified Doctor Adventures* with confidence. The Doctor is a transmedia traveller as much as a time traveller. Every format is valid. Every story is real.

And so, whether your first encounter is a 1960s paperback, a 2000s audio drama, or a new 2020s novel ‚Äî you are part of the same tradition: keeping the Doctor‚Äôs story alive.
